Star Talks of Slain Man 'No, I never was engaged to marry William Desmond Taylor, I regret to say.' This statement was made by pretty Mary Miles Minter in an interview at her home last night. 'Do you know where his ex-wife and daughter are?' Miss Minter was asked. Miss Minter's violet colored eyes flashed fire. 'Why he had no wife--he was never married. I'm positive of that,' she replied. 'But, maybe Mary, he didn't tell you he was married,' broke in Mother, Charlotte Shelby. 'But mother, I knew him so well--I am sure he wasn't married. I asked him if he was, and he told me no.'

Mr. Taylor was a man who knew everything,' said Miss Normand. 'If I wanted to know the meaning of an unusual word I did not have to take the trouble to look it up in the dictionary. I just had my secretary telephone Mr. Taylor.'

VALET TELLS OF FINDING BODY There were tears on the cheek of Henry Peavey, colored, who for six months had been employed as William Desmond Taylor's valet, as he told the story yesterday of how he discovered the murdered man's body upon entering the apartment yesterday morning. The night before, when Peavey left to go to his own home, Taylor called a cheery, 'Good night, Henry.' 'I can hear his voice yet,' said this humble mourner. 'It was the kind of strong, friendly voice that made a man feel good.' And then he burst out, 'I'd be willing to go to jail for the rest of my life if I could get the man that did it.' The valet was at his last task for the master; he was wiping up the blood from the floor, but his sobs shook him at times so that he could not proceed. 'I've worked for a lot of men,' he went on, 'but Mr. Taylor was the most wonderful of all of them. I came here this morning intending to fix his bath and get his breakfast, which I always does. And before the bath I'd bring him a dose of medicine. It was always just the same--for breakfast two soft- boiled eggs, toast and a glass of orange juice. 'And having it in my mind to make everything just as nice as I could, knowing he would be pleased and say a kind word, I opened the door. 'AND THEN I FOUND HIM STRETCHED OUT ON THE FLOOR, WHICH WAS ALL BLOODY AND HIS FEET TOWARD THE DOOR. 'And then I backed to the door, pretty near overcome with horror, and yelled for the landlord. The way I figure it is that somebody slipped in last night when Mr. Taylor took Miss Normand to the car and shot him from hiding. But how could any one kill such a man as he was?' Peavey lives at 127 1/2 East Third street. His habit was to reach the Taylor apartment before breakfast and leave after dinner.

[from an interview with Julia Crawford Ivers]...Mrs. Ivers then told of the difficulty Mr. Taylor said he had with his valet-secretary, Sands. 'There never was a more devoted man serving another than this man Sands during the first year and a half of his service for Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor trusted him with everything. '...Sands read everything he could find. He used to study into the late hours of the night and when Mr. Taylor told me of the various actions attributed to Sands, we all decided the man must have become deranged...'

Phone Used To Badger Taylor Mysterious telephone calls in the dark hours of the night foreshadowed the murder of William D. Taylor. This important information was given last night by Julia Crawford Ivers, for eight years scenario writer for the slain man and a close associate of his in the film industry. 'A few weeks before Christmas Mr. Taylor told us at the studio that he was considerably annoyed and mystified by telephone calls late at night. He said he would answer the phone only to find there was no one at the other end of the wire when he responded,' Mrs. Ivers said. 'These calls kept on coming at regular intervals, always with the same results. Mr. Taylor said he had not the slightest idea who was calling him or what the purpose was.' Harry Fellows, Mr. Taylor's assistant, confirmed the story. Mr. Taylor told him of these phone calls, he said. ...Mrs. Marjorie Berger said that Mr. Taylor had told her often that he had been getting mysterious phone calls. He talked so funny saying that he had wished sometimes that he had dropped prosecution [of Sands]. Mrs. Berger said: 'Why don't you get somebody to watch [your home]?' But he said, 'Oh, no.'

Officers last night were concentrating their efforts on locating a mysterious desperado who is sought as the slayer of William Desmond Taylor, one of the best known directors in the motion picture world, who was found murdered at his bungalow home of 404-B South Alvarado street yesterday morning. The officers were diligently following the trail of the mysterious man after they learned that several times the strange nocturnal visitor had been driven away by Taylor at the point of a gun. But two weeks ago, the investigators said Taylor found this man trying to gain entrance to the bungalow by means of a bedroom window. The window was half open and Taylor is said to have driven him away. Many times the murdered director is said to have heard unusual noises about the house and upon investigation found the unwelcome visitor prowling about the building or premises, but each time Taylor flourished a gun and drove him away. And then again, the police say in trying to weave a chain of incriminating evidence about the hunted man, Taylor received telephone calls which brought forth no response when he answered. It is believed the calls came from this person who was ascertaining if any one was at home at the bungalow. It was within half an hour after Mabel Normand, famous screen actress, and Taylor had a chat early Wednesday evening that he was killed, the police believe. They are also trying to run down clews which they say have found and which indicate that jealousy or revenge was the motive. They are inclined to believe that the former is the possible solution of the death. That a man committed the crime is based upon information furnished by Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of the film star, who lives next door to the Taylor home, and by her maid. They say they saw a mysterious man at the Taylor home before and after the murder. A .38 caliber steel-nose bullet caused Taylor's death. This was determined and the bullet found when Autopsy Surgeon Wagner performed a post mortem on the body early last night. The bullet had penetrated the back beneath the left shoulder blade, pierced the heart and then took a right upward course into the neck, where it lodged. While three theories are being considered by the police, certain material clews developed late yesterday lead them to believe that behind the tragedy is the shadow of a woman. The partly told story of Taylor's murder is this: At 6:45 Wednesday night he ate dinner in his little bungalow court home. He was alone. His servant was the only other person in the house. Shortly after 7 o'clock, Miss Mabel Normand. famous screen star, and whose engagement to the slain man had been generally rumored for many months but, denied by her, went to the Taylor home. She remained according to her story to the police, until about 7:45 o'clock. She had called for the purpose of obtaining a book that Taylor desired her to read. When she left, Taylor escorted her to her automobile, waiting at the entrance to the bungalow court. When Taylor departed from the house with Miss Normand he left the door open. What happened? The servant, Henry Peavey, a negro who has been with Taylor for about six months, said Miss Normand and Taylor were together in the living room when he left to go to his own home about 7:20 o'clock. Yesterday morning, as was his custom, he arrived to prepare breakfast at 7:30 o'clock. He had a key to the front door and opened it. He started to go in and then noticed Taylor lying on his back with his feet near the door. The servant did not enter. When Taylor faded to answer his alarmed cries he rushed to the home of a neighbor and called the police. Some time between 7:45 o'clock and 7:55 o'clock the night before, Taylor had been shot. Here are the theories on which police detectives are concentrating their efforts. Taylor was shot by-- 1. A woman he had scorned or whom he had enraged. 2. A discarded suitor of some woman with whom he had been friendly. 3. A burglar who was surprised by Taylor when he returned to the house after escorting Miss Normand to her car. Among the clews being followed by the police is one furnished by employees at the Morosco Theater, who stated that several weeks ago a man inquired for Taylor's address and by his insistence and strange actions aroused their suspicions. The officers are trying to locate this individual, who would not take 'no' for an answer to his questions as to where the director resided. A former secretary whom Taylor had caused to be arrested for forgery and who is said to have threatened his life, is being sought for information he may be able to give bearing on the case. Taylor is known to have been friendly with many women. He is said to have been a man of charming personality and of considerable magnetism. Outside of one particular prominent woman he was not known, say police, to have been particularly interested in any one. It is possible, say police, that some man, enamored of any one of the women with whom Taylor might have been on friendly terms, could have become enraged, waited his opportunity at the Taylor home, and then killed Taylor from ambush. Every possible angle of Taylor's private life is now being investigated by the detectives in connection with the first two theories. That the second will prove to be correct the officers believe. This belief is based on what Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of a motion picture director, residing in the house next to that of Taylor, saw. At 7:10, according to Mrs. MacLean's maid, Mr. and Mrs. MacLean sat down to dinner. While the second course was being served the maid claims to have heard footsteps of a man in a rear alley running between the two houses. She commented upon it to her employers, but thought nothing of it until she heard of the murder yesterday morning. At 7:50 o'clock, six minutes after Miss Normand left with Taylor to go to her machine, Mrs. MacLean heard a shot and went to her door. A man was just leaving the Taylor home. He was not Sands, the valet. Mrs. MacLean is sure of this, she says. She knew Sands. When she saw the man he was just stepping through the door. He turned half-way around, glanced back through the door and then pulled it shut. He saw her, she says, as she stood watching him, but did not show any alarm. She closed her door just as he started away from the Taylor home. He walked, she declared, not out to Alvarado street to the main entrance, but disappeared through the alley leading between Taylor's house and hers. The mysterious visitor was large of stature. wore dark rough clothing and had a muffler and cap on. She could not see his face. This man, the police believe, is the murderer. They believe it was he whom the MacLean's maid heard as she was serving dinner. It is probable, they think, that he was acquainted with Taylor's habits. Friends say that Taylor left the door open when he left his home for a few minutes. The mysterious visitor is believed to have secreted himself around the corner of the house and watched until Taylor came out with Miss Normand. As the two walked toward the film star's car, the assassin probably hurried into the house through the door left open by his victim. When Taylor was found his body was lying with the head toward the east wall, directly in front of a writing desk. The feet were near the door, the legs outstretched. He was on his back. It is the police theory that when he returned to the house after bidding Miss Normand good night he sat down at the desk to work. An open check book was lying on the desk, a pen nearby, when the murder was discovered. The murderer, waiting behind a pillar in the room, stepped out when he believed Taylor to be settled in the chair and fired. The bullet entered below the left shoulder blade and penetrated the heart. Taylor died instantly, pitched forward and in failing upset the chair. The chair was found lying across his legs when the body was discovered. Intimate friends say that it was the one used by Taylor at his desk. The murderer is then believed to have hurried to the door, glanced back just as Mrs. MacLean discovered him and then fled through the alley. When Peavey, the servant, saw the body of his dead master, as he opened the front door yesterday morning, screaming into the bungalow court yard, Mrs. Verne Dumas, who heard his cries, called the police. Detectives who responded made a casual examination, but did not turn the body over until Coroner Nance reached the scene. The first report issued from the headquarters was that Taylor had died of natural of causes. As soon as it became known that the director had been murdered Detective Captain David Adams assigned every available officer to the case. Officials from the public administrator's office were sent to the house and took charge of the dead man's personal effects. Thousands of dollars worth of jewels were found in his bedroom. A half completed income tax blank lying on the desk showed his annual income to be $37,000. Coroner Nance ordered the body sent to the undertaking parlors of Ivy Overholtzer on South Flower street and detectives then began the work of running down the murderer. According to Peavey, the servant, his murdered master had no enemies that he knew of nor had he had any difficulty with any guest that had visited the house while he was present. When he left for the night Wednesday, Taylor seemed to be in high spirits and was conversing in an animated manner with Miss Normand. Police are convinced that the servant can throw no light on the mystery. Miss Normand told Detective Sergeants Wallace and Ziegler that she had gone to two jewelry stores downtown before she went to Taylor's home. They were closed and after buying some peanuts from a vendor at Seventh street and Broadway and a copy of the Police Gazette she hurried to Taylor's home. Her story and that of her chauffeur, William Davis, coincide. Miss Normand claims that she left the Taylor home about 7:45 o'clock, and that the director walked with her to the machine, leaving, as was his custom, the door open behind him. When they reached the car, she says, her chauffeur had been reading the magazine. He hastily threw it aside and Taylor saw it. The couple had been discussing literature and he chided her good naturedly about reading that type of magazine. She says that after she left Taylor at the curbing she immediately returned to her home. While in Taylor's home she had discussed with Taylor a certain charge made against his negro servant involving social vagrancy. Miss Normand was informed by motion picture friends of the tragedy soon after the body was discovered. She refused to receive callers outside of headquarters officers and close intimate friends. To further the theory that Taylor was killed by some one other than his former valet, police point to a story told by a guest in the Dumas home, near by, who claims that on last Monday night early he saw two men go up to the door of the Taylor home, try the door with a key and then walk away. One of these men is believed to have been the murderer. Several others in the block beside Mr. and Mrs. MacLean claim to have heard the fatal shot. E. C. Jessurum, owner of the court, who was ill in bed heard it and called it to the attention of his wife. who was reading to him. Not hearing a second shot, they thought nothing of the interruption. One of the first visitors at the Taylor home after police detectives had taken charge was Mary Miles Minter, mutual friend of Miss Normand and the murdered man. Friends had informed her of the tragedy. Accompanied by her mother, she hurried to the Taylor home, but was met at the door by Detective Sergeant Hermann Cline, who briefly told her what had happened. She became hysterical and it was several minutes before she could talk coherently. She said that Taylor had directed her in three pictures and that she considered him an intimate friend. She knew of no enemies that might have sought his death, she said. 'Why, he was a wonderful man,' she added, 'and every one that knew him loved him.' This sentiment was voiced too, by her mother. Miss Minter said that the last time she saw Taylor was Wednesday afternoon, when she met him at the corner of Seventh and Alvarado streets. That Taylor had a premonition of his death and told several friends was learned last night. According to Mrs. J. M. Berger, income tax specialist, who is at present engaged by Miss Normand, the murdered man told her Wednesday afternoon that 'he felt that something was going to happen to him.' They laughed the subject away, though, and apparently Taylor forgot it. He told the same thing to other persons--friends in the motion picture colony, but all ridiculed the idea. The house in which Taylor was found is lavishly furnished. The lower floor consists of a living room, dining room and kitchen. Upstairs, with the stairway leading from the dining room, are two bedrooms. One of these rooms was used by Taylor to sleep in. The other was reserved as a guest chamber. Photographs, all of them affectionately autographed, of famous stars, whom Taylor had directed are the most conspicuous decorations in the living room. These include one of Mary Pickford, who describes Taylor as 'the most patient man I ever knew.' A search of the house by detectives and the deputy police administrator revealed a large quantity of expensive bonded liquors. This was taken charge of together with his other personal effects. Late yesterday afternoon Detective Captain Adams assigned Detectives Sergeants Hermann Cline, Murphy and Winn to the case. The detectives, after interviewing Miss Normand's chauffeur, admitted that the case is one of the most baffling that has confronted the Los Angeles department for many years. Sands, the former valet being sought, is said to be in Los Angeles, and several friends of Taylor told police last night that they had seen him. Every officer has been furnished with his description and given orders to arrest him on sight. Police are not yet ready, they say, to implicate him in the murder, but he is the one known man who would have a motive for desiring Taylor's death, and his explanation of where he was on the night of the murder is anxiously awaited by officers. If he is innocent, they believe, despite felony warrant already issued for him, he will surrender rather than take the chance of being accused of suspicion of murder by remaining in hiding.

Miss Edna Purviance, who lived in the two-story bungalow adjoining the home of William D. Taylor, the Lasky film director who was shot Wednesday night, said that when she returned to her home some time near midnight Wednesday she noticed lights burning in Mr. Taylor's house, but that as Mr. Taylor was given to burning the midnight oil, being a great reader, she thought nothing of it. 'I was awakened,' said Miss Purviance last night, 'early Thursday morning by the terrifying voice of some one who seemed to be running up and down the court, screaming, 'Mr. Taylor is dead! Mr. Taylor is dead!' I looked out the window and saw his negro boy Henry, who was almost frantic with grief, as he was very much attached to Mr. Taylor. 'Before they found the bullet wound in Mr. Taylor's back they thought he had died of heart disease, and that seemed terrible enough, but when we learned he had been murdered, almost at our own door, it seemed too horrible to believe. 'I knew Mr. Taylor only very slightly. I had never worked with him and had only met him to a purely formal social way. I thought him to be a very interesting, likable, discerning gentleman, with gallant, polished manners and a brilliant intellect. 'I always heard him spoken of as a man with a reputation above reproach and a nature that was kind and generous. Although living as a near neighbor, I saw him very infrequently and knew nothing of his private life or of his love affairs, if he had any. I knew that he and Miss Normand were good friends but knew nothing of heart interest on either side.'

All the picture studios in Los Angeles were in mourning yesterday. The mysterious murder of William Desmond Taylor shocked the entire motion picture colony and held the focus of attention on every 'lot' in Los Angeles. It is probable that no man in the motion picture business had more friends than the slain director. He had directed virtually every well-known star and thus had come in contact with hundreds of men and women in the various studios in which he had worked. The majority of those who learned the circumstances of Taylor's mysterious death were inclined toward the theory that robbery was the motive. They believe a sneak thief had entered the house during Taylor's temporary absence and that Taylor discovered his presence on his return. The subsequent struggle and shot, they believe, frightened the marauder away without any booty. Comments were heard in many studios on the fact that Taylor had had trouble with Ed. F. Sands, former valet-secretary to the dead man. A felony warrant has been out for Sands for several months and many friends of Mr. Taylor expressed a strong wish to learn Sands' present whereabouts. The theory that there was a 'love motive' in the crime and that its unraveling will reveal a woman either as the instigator, perpetrator or unconscious motive for the shooting was scoffed at by Taylor's friends. From every 'lot' in Los Angeles came the testimony that Taylor had led a life unusually free from feminine entanglements. Charles Eyton, studio manager at Lasky's was emphatic in discrediting the 'Cherchez la Femme' theory of the crime... The same opinion ruled among the press representatives at the Laksy studio where Taylor was well known and warmly admired. Arch Reeve, Barrett Kiesling and Al Wilkie, all of whom had known Taylor for years were convinced that robbery was the motive for the killing. They described him as a man of solitary habits, quiet and reserved, whose name the breath of scandal never had touched... Mary Miles Minter was another star who was greatly shocked by the occurrence. With tears streaming down her face she recalled incidents that happened the last time she had talked with the director...

Miss Mabel Normand, Mack Sennett film star, who was probably the last friend to see William D. Taylor, the Lasky film director who was shot Wednesday night, alive, told in detail late yesterday afternoon, the time and the incidents of her visit to his home early in the evening, previous to the shooting, and stated that she had no doubt that the person who shot him was the man who had twice robbed him and who had annoyed him with mysterious telephone calls recently. 'There was no affair of the heart whatever between William D. Taylor and myself,' said Miss Normand yesterday afternoon at her beautiful home in West Seventh and Vermont avenue. 'His friendship for me was that of an older man for a girl who liked the outdoor sports he liked and who was eager to glean a little enlightenment from the vast storehouse of knowledge which he possessed. 'Mr. Taylor was a man who knew everything. If I wanted to know the meaning of an unusual word I did not have to take the trouble to hunt up a dictionary. I just had my secretary telephone Mr. Taylor. If I wanted to find the name of a painter or sculptor of some rare work of art he was sure to know that, too, and if I were puzzling over some classical or scientific reference in my reading, I only had to ask him to have the entire matter explained, for besides having the education and the instincts of an artist, he was a deep student of science as well. 'I liked to go out with Mr. Taylor because there was a certain protective dignity in his quiet high bred manner that prevented the obtrusive, offensively familiar person who had only seen my face on the screen, from running up and saying, 'Hello, Mabel!' and we were the best of pals. I think Mr. Taylor had the finest, highest sense of honor of almost any one I have ever known, and I respected him and admired him more than I can tell. My chief liking for him, however, was because of his wonderful brain and the things he could teach me. I am studying French, and as he spoke French fluently he was of great assistance to me and there was hardly a day that he did not recommend some book to me to read. It was to get a book he had phoned about that I went to his house Wednesday evening about 7 o'clock. 'I had been downtown shopping and was at my bank and phoned home to my housekeeper to know if there had been any calls for me. She said Mr. Taylor had phoned that he had the book I wanted, so I attended to a few errands and had my chauffeur drive me by Mr. Taylor's home. I sat down for a few minutes, commented on the change he had made in some bookcases, I had not seen the place in a couple of months. We talked a little of books and plays and he asked me to stay for dinner, saying that although he had had his dinner, he wanted me to try a certain kind of rice pudding his cook had made, but I told him that I had phoned home I would be back to dinner and they were expecting me. 'He then told his colored boy that I would not be staying for dinner and the boy went out just ahead of us. Mr. Taylor took me to my car and on the floor of the car were a number of magazines, some of them, were rather light and I suppose sensational. Mr. Taylor expressed surprise that I read such things and rather upbraided me for having such low-brow taste. He gave me the book, as I got in the car. It was one of Freud's latest, and said I will phone after while and see how you like it. That was the last I ever heard his voice. This morning when Edna Purviance rushed in and said Mr. Taylor was dead I was sure it was all some horrible mistake. 'I came home from Mr. Taylor's house, had my dinner and was in bed before 9 o'clock. I read a little while and when he did not phone I wondered a little and then thought no more about it and went to sleep. 'Mr. Taylor was so uniformly kind to every one. It seems horrible that he should have met a death of this kind, and with the exception of the man who had been in his employ and who had robbed him, I cannot believe he had an enemy in the world. He had a warrant sworn out for the man, but he had never been apprehended. Yesterday Mr. Taylor told his secretary that he had a strange presentment about this man and wished he had not had the warrant sworn-out. 'I wish there were something I could do to throw some light on this terrible tragedy, but it was mere chance that took me to his door a few hours before it happened and I feel very indignant as do also the members of my household and the managers and directors of my company, that my name should have been unnecessarily connected with the unhappy event. Any one, out of scores of his acquaintances might have called at his house on that particular evening and it seemed a cruel thing to me that I should be questioned about it. 'I have known Mr. Taylor for six or seven years. He had high ideals regarding his work and a far reaching vision that made him have great faith in the wonderful things that the moving picture has yet to do. He not only had an eye for beautiful objects and harmony of composition and arrangement, but he had a soul that appreciated the abstract beauty that these things stood for as symbols. To him loyalty, honor, faith, justice and beauty were realities. They were forces that move the world onward and sculpture out recognized qualities in the human countenance. And it was the clean, wholesome beautiful things of life that he wanted to portray on screen. 'Mr. Taylor was a wonderful conversationalist because he observed everything and everybody with the eye of understanding sympathy. He could tell of his travels in Alaska or his trips through Europe and the stories would not be merely geographical descriptions of countries and customs, but philosophical observations that made all of his experiences a commentary on life. 'I feel proud to have called such a man friend and am sorry that his extreme modesty and diffidence kept many from knowing the depth and brilliance of his true nature. But he was not in the least pedantic or high- browish. He was full of wit and jest and he would tease and twit me about things I did or wore, and sometimes we would have a perfect gab fest, in slang, just like a couple of kids. He was just an all around, sure-enough human being. 'I am just in the middle of a big picture and, of course, I am going right on working, but the sudden news of the tragic death of such a friend as this was naturally a great shock to me and I am all broken up today.' Besieged by friends, members of her profession and representatives of the press, Miss Normand denied herself to all callers yesterday and remained in the seclusion of her room, a dainty rose and old ivory boudoir whose walls are lined with books of verse, of plays, of fiction, philosophy, science and history. There were books on the dresser, scattered all over gold-mounted toilet articles, big fat books on art sprawling all over a chaise-lounge, and on a little stand by her bed there were some volumes of poetry and psycho- analytical philosophy. 'Yes, I do read a great deal,' confessed Miss Normand, 'one has to in order to understand what other people are talking about and most of the books you see here were either given me or suggested by Mr. Taylor. I sometimes wondered how he ever got the time to read all the different kinds, of things he had read. 'Mr. Taylor was a man who would have been a credit to any profession on the face of the earth, because he lived a clean, wholesome, upright, life of kindness and usefulness to his fellow beings. Those of us who believe in our art and our profession and have ideals and ambitions for the attainment of success and for that thing which is valued above great riches, a good name, feel that we have not only lost a personal friend but that the profession has lost a rare exemplar whose influence will be missed by all.'

Tracing the movements of a man suspected of being the slayer of William Desmond Taylor, internationally known film director, who was shot to death in his Alvarado-street apartments Wednesday night, investigators for The Times last night located four witnesses who saw the man before and after the tragedy. Actuated by motives of revenge due to jealousy, the police believe, the murderer fired the fatal shot as near as can be calculated a few minutes before 7:45 p.m., as Mr. Taylor was seated at his writing desk or just as he returned and closed the door when he returned from escorting Mabel Normand, actress, to her car. Between 7:45 and 7:50 p.m., just after the report of the revolver was heard, Mrs. MacLean, wife of Douglas MacLean, the actor, who lives near the Taylor home, saw a man leaving the Taylor apartments. He was described as being about five feet nine or ten inches tall, of medium build and roughly, but not shabbily dressed in dark clothes and a plaid cap. Shortly before 6 o'clock a man answering this description stopped at the Hartley service station, Sixth and Alvarado streets, and inquired where W. D. Taylor resided. Floyd Hartley, 231 South Bonnie Brae street, and L. A. Grant, in charge of the station, were in the place at the time. The circumstances recited by both of these witnesses tally to the minutest detail. The inquirer was 26 or 27 years old, they said, weighed about 165 pounds, wore a dark suit, probably of blue serge, and a light hat or cap. He had dark hair and was of medium complexion. They directed him to the Alvarado Terrace Apartments and he left the oil station. He walked toward the apartments. That was the last they saw of him. Maryland street runs east and west at the rear of Mr. Taylor's apartment. It is a street car stop on the West First-street car line, but passengers board cars there at only rare intervals, possibly not for months. E. W. Dascomb, conductor, and R. S. Woodard, motorman, stated that a man answering the description boarded their car at either 7:54 or 8:27 p.m. They were not certain which stop it was, but took notice because of the infrequency with which passengers are taken on the Maryland-street stop. 'I took particular notice of this passenger on that account,' said Conductor Dascomb. 'It was an inbound trip. This fellow was about five feet and ten inches tall, fairly well dressed, as I remember, weighed about 165 pounds, and his hat or cap was of a light color. I remember that he wore something tan, but I don't recall whether it was his coat or vest. I can't remember where he got off, but I think I would know him again.' Motorman Woodard recalled that Mr. Grant, in charge of the oil station, had mentioned the circumstances of a man inquiring for Mr. Taylor, and of the similarity in descriptions. The descriptions given by Mrs. MacLean, Mr. Woodward, and Mr. Dascomb tally so closely that authorities believe there is little doubt but what that three people saw the same man. It is believed that the slayer had no automobile. Persons residing in the vicinity have taken special notice of machines parked there 'because the noise kept them awake,' and they do not recall having seen any cars parked on Maryland street that night. This lends confirmation to the theory that the killer boarded a West First-street car. Mrs. J. H. Tander and her three sons reside directly across from Mr. Taylor's apartment at 360 South Alvarado Street. The occupants of the house were awake until after 9:30 p.m. and observed no automobile nor saw anyone loitering in the vicinity. Persons residing at 401 Westlake avenue, the house adjacent from Mr. Taylor's apartments, give similar information. Several hours were devoted yesterday to questioning Mabel Normand, well- known motion-picture actress and asserted fiancee of Mr. Taylor. Miss Normand is the last person thus far found who saw him alive. Her chauffeur, William Davis, also was questioned. Their stories were that Miss Normand left the Taylor apartments, 404-B South Alvarado street, at 7:45 p.m. Wednesday. Mr. Taylor accompanied her to the automobile. Immediately after checking up on this phase of the case the police started a search for the man Mrs. MacLean saw leaving the apartments between 7:45 and 7:50 p.m. soon after the report of a pistol shot was heard. While a search was under way for this man, the police also were making energetic efforts to find E. F. Sands, former secretary of Mr. Taylor, who was accused several months ago of forgery by the latter. Since a warrant was issued for the arrest of Sands on the asserted forgeries no trace of his whereabouts has been found. The tremendous resources of the Famous Players-Lasky organization were offered the police yesterday by Jesse L. Lasky, first vice-president of the company, for the capture of the assassin of the film director. Unlimited supply of money, time and effort was promised to the detectives, and every possible assistance will be given them by Mr. Taylor's friends and former associates, the officers were told. News of the murder stirred the motion-picture colony. Several intimate friends rushed to the home, among them being Mary Miles Minter, who became almost hysterical. The revenge and jealousy motive as a theory was strengthened by the fact that none of the valuables in the apartments or in Mr. Taylor's clothing was disturbed. About $78 in money was in his pocketbook, a two-carat diamond ring was not taken, and his platinum watch also was left. Detective Sergeants Herman Cline, Murphy, Cato, Cahill, Zeigler and Wallace, checked many clews. Among one of the leads furnished the police was a report that a man, eager to see Mr. Taylor, had inquired two days before at the Morosco Theater for his residence address, and insisted on getting it at once. The actions of this man aroused suspicion. An autopsy performed at the Ivy Overholtzer undertaking establishment showed that Mr. Taylor had been shot from the back with a .38-caliber revolver. Only one bullet was found. It entered on the left side toward the back about six inches under the arm pit. The course of the bullet indicated it had gone upwards and it was extracted in the fleshy part of the neck on the right side just below the ear. Both lobes of the left lung had been punctured. The nearest approach to an eyewitness account of the crime was furnished by Mrs. MacLean. About 7:45 p.m. she heard the shot and when she looked out the window she saw a man she described as roughly dressed, wearing a plaid cap, open the door of the Taylor apartment. The porch light was turned on, as were the lights in the rest of the house, she stated. This man paused as he came out of the door, looked around as if talking to some one inside and then left. He walked to an alley that leads to Maryland street, passing between Mr. Taylor's house and that of Mrs. MacLean. The murderer, it is believed, lurked in the shadows back to the Taylor flat and in the narrow alley between it and the garage, waiting for his opportunity. This theory of the police was reinforced last night by the discovery of six cigarette stubs in the immediate vicinity of the back door of the Taylor flat and in the alley facing the east windows of the murdered man's apartment. A maid at the MacLean home also said she heard some one lurking in the alley about 7:15 p.m. and heard the fatal shot about thirty minutes later. The man who smoked the cigarettes was very nervous. The half-smoked cigarettes show that. They were scattered around. One was barely touched. Evidently this one was the last one smoked by the man while waiting. It was found in the alley, leading the detectives to believe that the man threw it away almost immediately after lighting it, and that he watched Mr. Taylor leave the house. The back door of the Taylor flat opens on the sidewalk of the south side of Maryland street, just east of Alvarado. Between the east side of the structure where the Taylor flat is located and the garage used by occupants of the flats in the court is a narrow, cement-paved alley. This alley, too, leads into Maryland street. A large tree affords ample protection from the light on Alvarado street at night, blocks the view of the house. It is in the shadow of this tree, the officers believe, that the murderer lay in wait, smoking his cigarettes. More than half a dozen of matches were found on the lawn between the curb of Maryland street and the back window of the Taylor flat. The opportunity for him to enter the house came, the police believe, when Mr. Taylor escorted Miss Normand to her automobile. During the few minutes required for this, the murderer slipped into the open door and waited behind it for the return of Mr. Taylor, the officers think. Mrs. MacLean, who knows Sands, stated the man who left the Taylor apartment did not look familiar to her. The investigators, however, have not relaxed their efforts to find Sands in order to question him in the hope he may be able to aid them in solving the mystery. Mr. Taylor left the Famous Players-Lasky studio, where he was a director, at 4:30 p.m., Wednesday, according to Barrett Keisling, publicity man. From the story related by Henry Peavey, negro, houseman, who found the body, Mr. Taylor came immediately home, ate dinner and was visited by Miss Normand. Los Angeles and New York film colonies were deeply affected by the news of the murder. Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle, awaiting the verdict in his manslaughter trial in San Francisco, said: 'Mr. Taylor's death comes as a great shock to me. We were good friends and never a whisper of scandal arouse about him. He was one of the finest fellows on the 'lot.'' Detective Sergts. Cline, Wynn and Murphy questioned several friends of Mr. Taylor late last night in an effort to obtain any information that may aid in solving the mystery. Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill, both personal friends of Mr. Taylor, left the police station late last night to question a former sweetheart of Mr. Taylor. They declined to divulge her name. Mary Miles Minter, who was directed in several plays by Mr. Taylor and who holds high regard for him, declared yesterday she could think of no enemies or persons who would have a motive in killing him. She denied reports she had ever been engaged to marry him, saying she was extremely sorry she never had been, because she admired him greatly as a man.

While the police were endeavoring to solve the mystery of who murdered William D. Taylor, motion picture director, his colored houseman, Henry Peavey, who discovered the body yesterday morning, was slated to appear in Police Court to answer a charge of vagrancy. The case, slated for Judge Chamber's court, was called, but on account of Peavey's absence was put over, the date to be set later. Peavey's arrest followed asserted acts of indecency several days ago in Westlake Park.

Among the mute evidences of what had taken place in the home of William D. Taylor Wednesday night, when he was shot, was an expensive silver and cut- glass drinking service. On it were a decanter, a shaker used in mixing drinks, and two large glasses with portions of a drink left in them. Cigarette stubs littered the tray. In the glasses was orange pulp, apparently left from an orange and gin concoction. This service was found on the dining-room table. The body was in an adjoining room.

Mabel Normand, seen at her home at Seventh street and Vermont avenue yesterday, was much agitated over the murder of her old friend, William D. Taylor. She gave a clear and frank statement of all her movements Wednesday afternoon and evening. J. A. Waldron, the Mack Sennett studio manager, was with her all day, answering phone calls and receiving messages, Miss Normand stated. Continuing, she stated that she spent the afternoon downtown, attending principally to income tax matters and to her banking. She then called her home from the bank at Sixth and Main streets and asked if there were any messages for her. Her maid said: 'Mr. Taylor has been trying to get you all the afternoon, and we told him that you were out. We told him you were downtown.' 'He had been trying to get some books for me that I wanted,' said Miss Normand. 'We always discussed books a great deal. He told the maid he had got one of the books at Parker's and was sending it by his chauffeur. He said that he had obtained the other book I wanted at Robinson's, and left word with the maid for me to stop at his house and get it. 'I went and bought 5 cents worth of peanuts, but the man didn't have any change; so I went to the drug store in the Pacific Electric Building and got the change. I bought a lot of magazines and papers, among others a Police Gazette. I ate the peanuts on the way, and we drove out to Mr. Taylor's, and when I got out I told my chauffeur to clean the car. Then I went up on the steps. I heard Mr. Taylor talking to somebody over the phone, underneath the stairs, and I hesitated about going in until he had finished. Then I entered. He had been talking to Mrs. Marjorie Berger, who has charge of the income tax business for many of the picture folk, including myself. 'He came in and said, 'Gee, I am glad to see you.' I said, 'I just came up for the book.' 'I arrived at his house about five minutes after 7. We talked about books. I looked around his drawing-room, and told him I thought he had changed his house furnishings. He said, 'You haven't been here for so long you forgot.' I hadn't been to his house before in two months. He said, 'The Victrola is the only thing new.' 'His servant, Henry, had been arrested for some sort of misconduct, and he was saying that perhaps he would have to go down to court tomorrow (that's today) to see about it. Henry came in, and I said to Mr. Taylor, 'Have you had your dinner?' He said, 'Yes, have you had yours?' I said, 'No, but I am tired, and I'm going home now. I have a studio call for 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.' I've been going to bed very early every night--haven't been anywhere since I began work on my present picture. 'We were talking about the cameraman's ball next Saturday night, and he said he had a box, and I said I had one. He told me whom he was going to take and wanted to know whom I was going to take. 'Henry went out and talked to my chauffeur as my chauffeur cleaned up the car. Henry was telling my chauffeur what a nice man Taylor was to work for. 'Finally Mr. Taylor said 'Well, if you're tired why don't you go home and rest and I will call you up this evening.' I asked Mr. Taylor who lived in the different bungalows in the court, and he told me. We stood outside two or three minutes talking. He had left his door open. He put me in the car, and as he saw the peanut shells, and the pile of books, he laughed and said: 'Here you are with Nietzsche under one arm and Freud under the other and the Police Gazette close by. You certainly are going in for heavy reading this winter.' I said, 'Yes, I wish I could get hold of Joe Miller's Joke Book: that would complete the set.' Then he said 'Good-night, I will call you up in about an hour.' 'I went home, had my dinner at once and was in bed and asleep by 8 o'clock. I didn't have to go to the studio this morning because there was something the matter with the set. 'Edna Purviance called me up this morning and said 'Have you heard the terrible news? William D. Taylor's valet is running up and down the court screaming he is dead. They say he died of heart failure.' Afterward I learned that he had been murdered. 'I hear that Mr. Taylor told Mrs. Berger he wished that he had called off the warrant he had against Sands. I understand that he felt apprehensive of harm from him. There were, I hear, all sorts of mysterious telephone calls and all that. Sands was one of those servile human beings, apparently all devotion to Mr. Taylor.' Miss Normand says that Edward Knoblock had Mr. Taylor's house while Mr. Taylor was in Europe last summer and that Mr. Taylor had Mr. Knoblock's London house. Sands apparently stayed right along in Mr. Taylor's service in Los Angeles, and also assisted Mr. Knoblock. Two or three days before Mr. Taylor was to arrive from London, Sands told Mr. Knoblock that he thought he would take two or three days leave of absence, but would be back soon. He never showed up again. When Mr. Taylor arrived from London, he said he found that Sands had stolen everything, had forged his name to checks and had gone to Hamburger's and bought lingerie. He had a sweetheart here. Miss Normand doesn't know who she was. A few weeks ago Mr. Taylor's house was robbed again. Then from Stockton he kept getting anonymous letters, and he received a pawnbroker's ticket, showing that things had been pawned in the name of a Mrs. Tennant [sic], who is Mr. Taylor's sister-in-law. The way Mr. Taylor knew it was really Sands was because he had always spelled Mrs. Tennent's name wrong, and the wrong spelling was on the ticket. 'Mr. Taylor knew that Sands wasn't out of California by this fact,' said Miss Normand. Mrs. Marjorie Burger [sic] said that Mr. Taylor had told her often that he had been getting mysterious phone calls. He talked so funny, saying that he had wished sometimes that he had dropped prosecution. Mrs. Burger said: 'Why don't you get somebody to watch?' But he said, 'Oh, no.' As for Mabel Normand's reported engagement to Mr. Taylor: she said, 'We have always been great friends. We love to talk over books and that sort of thing. He's the sort of man who can come to the house, sit and read while I play the piano, and talk informally over our work and over our books.' Mabel Normand admitted that Mr. Taylor had asked her to marry him, but that phase of the friendship had been over for some time. They were just good pals, she said. Miss Normand and Mr. Taylor were seen out together a great deal at one time; but of late they have hardly seen each other at all, she said.

The first theory of the murder of William D. Taylor, motion-picture director, evolved by the detectives assigned to the case, was as follows: Mr. Taylor, just finishing his dinner, was visited by Mabel Normand. They discussed a scenario and several other matters relating to motion pictures. Some time shortly after 7 p.m. Henry Peavey, negro houseman employed by Taylor, left the apartments for the night, leaving Mr. Taylor and Miss Normand. About 7:45 p.m., Miss Normand left the apartment, according to her statement. She was accompanied to her automobile at the curbing by Mr. Taylor. Her negro [sic] chauffeur was waiting for her and drove her home, which she reached about 8 o'clock. It was during this absence from the house by Mr. Taylor that his slayer entered the apartment through the door that had been left open, the theory goes. When Mr. Taylor entered the door on his return he was immediately attacked, being shot from the back, probably as he closed the door. The assailant left immediately. The shot was heard about 7:45 p.m., according to the account given by Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of Douglas MacLean, motion-picture actor. Her maid also heard the report. Mrs. MacLean went to the door of her apartment and saw a man leaving by the front door of Mr. Taylor's home. He closed the door and looked around back of him. Then he walked between the Taylor house and the one adjacent on the west [sic], going north by the side entrance to Maryland street. The description of this man was given to the officer

Henry Peavey had been employed about six months by Mr. Taylor as houseman and valet. He never slept in the house, leaving after the dinner, if his master ate at home and returning the next morning. 'I had turned back the covers on Mr. Taylor's bed, put some ice water on the table and finished the supper things,' Peavey related. 'The income tax lady called on the telephone, and then Miss Normand arrived in her automobile. They sat in rocking chairs and talked about some book. Mr. Taylor was always reading books. He sometimes told me he had read until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. Once when he was making a picture he showed me a pile of books, and said, 'I've got to read all these.' 'Well, I motioned to Mr. Taylor and he said, 'You may go now, Henry.' That was about 7:30 o'clock. On the way to work in the morning I stopped at a drug store and got a bottle of milk of magnesia. I often got that for Mr. Taylor. I'd just buy it with my own money and every once in a while tell him how much I had spent. He was a good man. He never asked me what I had spent money for; just how much I had spent to keep him comfortable. As soon as I opened the door I saw his feet. I said, 'Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor.' Then I peeped in and saw his face, and I knew something had happened. I started to yell and all the people in the court came out. I ran to the landlord. No, sir, I didn't go into the house. No, sir. 'Mr. Taylor had few friends call. I can only remember his having people for dinner two or three times since I have been with him. At night he would stay home and read. He went out little and drank very little. He was a very good man.'

The discovery of the murder of William Desmond Taylor was made about 7:30 a.m. yesterday when Henry Peavey, colored house man employed by Taylor, came to work. Peavey says he opened the front door and was first attracted by the body lying on the floor of the living-room, when he saw Mr. Taylor's feet. The body was feet toward the door and over the legs was a chair that apparently had been overturned. Peavey declares he called to his employer and then decided he was dead. 'I ran from the house, ' Peavey said, 'and the folks around here say I made a commotion. The neighbors came running and later they took the body away.' Peavey last saw Mr. Taylor alive Wednesday night about 7:30 o'clock, he said. He had prepared dinner for him and just as he was serving dessert, Mabel Normand, well-known film actress and said by friends to have been his fiancee, came to see Mr. Taylor. This visit began about 7 o'clock, Peavey stated. When he left the home at 7:30 p.m., Miss Normand was still there. A physician was called and at first it was believed the death was of natural causes, probably brought about by a hemorrhage. It was not until a considerable time after the remains were taken to the Ivy Overholtzer undertaking establishment that discovery was made that Mr. Taylor had been shot. The wound was in the back, entering at the left side in a line under the heart. A steel jacketed bullet apparently had been used and the wound had practically closed up thus making detection at first difficult. Peavey said he had been in the employ of Mr. Taylor for about six months. Mr. Taylor had lived in the apartments at the Alvarado courts about two years. The scene left in the magnificently appointed apartment occupied by Mr. Taylor showed little signs of a struggle. The overturned chair was the only indication of a struggle or of the haste of the assailant to escape. The door, which has a night latch, was locked from the outside, but the latch was set so that no key was necessary to accomplish this. A writing desk was situated near the door, against the front wall of the room. On this desk were many papers indicating that Mr. Taylor had been preparing his income tax return for this year and adjusting other business. Some scenarios also were scattered about. On top of the desk was a picture of Mabel Normand. In a place of honor on the top of the upright piano was a photograph of Miss Normand. Three, in all, were conspicuously displayed. Photographs of many persons known throughout the world as film stars also were displayed in the rooms of the apartment. About the border of the living room and dining-room Mr. Taylor had placed a solid border of autographed and framed photographs. Among them were pictures of Mary Pickford, whom he had directed in three pictures before enlisting in the World War. On this picture was written, 'To my nice director, William Taylor, the most patient man that I know, with sincere friendship, Mary Pickford.' In a prominent place was Mary Miles Minter's photograph. This bore the following expression of admiration: 'For William Desmond Taylor, Artist, gentleman, man! Sincere good wishes, Mary Miles Minter, 1920.' Soon after the news of the murder had spread, Mary Miles Minter and her mother rushed to the house to see if they could be of any aid. Miss Minter declared that Mabel Normand had been engaged for about six months to Mr. Taylor. The grief of Miss Minter was shown by the tears which she shed while viewing the scene where her friend had been shot. Later in the morning Frank O'Connor, formerly an assistant director under Mr. Taylor and for many years a close friend, visited the apartments. He sounded high praise for Mr. Taylor. Charles Eyton, general manager of the Lasky studio, was present when the undertaker removed the valuables from the person of Mr. Taylor. L. P. Waterman, deputy public administrator, was called and assumed charge of the property. Detective Sergeants Zeigler and Wallis, assigned to the case when the first report of the death was made to the police, interviewed Miss Normand and obtained a statement from her, they reported, that she had left the apartment some time around 8 o'clock. She was not sure of the time, but placed it at approximately 7:45 p.m. In the court where Mr. Taylor lived there are sixteen apartments. It is composed of eight two-story white stucco buildings. E. C. Jessurun, proprietor of the court, responded to the alarm raised by the negro houseman.

In the numerous romances of William Desmond Taylor with the beautiful women in Hollywood's movie colony, the police are seeking a clew to lead them to his assassin. Names famous in movieland are being linked with the story of the tragedy. The mystery of the slaying and the stories of gallantries in which Taylor is the hero, overshadow any of those pictured in the film studios where he was one of the moving spirits. Three women movie stars are known to have visited his luxurious bungalow at 404B South Alvarado street, where his body was found this morning, within a few hours of the time he must have died. The slayer now is believed to have been hiding near the bungalow while Mabel Normand was with Taylor, a period of perhaps two hours. When Taylor left the house to escort Miss Normand, the slayer is believed to have slipped into the house, to lurk there until the chance came to end the life of the man he hated. Another actress of national repute went to the house about two hours later, the detectives have been told. What was the purpose or the result of her visit has not been disclosed as yet. At the time of her visit, according to the opinion of physicians, Taylor had been dead for nearly two hours. The police seek an answer to the double-barreled question: 'What did this beautiful actress go to see, and what did she see?' An hour later Edna Purviance, a next door neighbor and long time friend of Taylor, reached her home. She saw a light in Taylor's study and rang his bell. There was no answer. She told the police she decided he was out or did not wish visitors, so she went to her own home. With these facts for a background and stories of Taylor's love affairs, gleaned in the studios, the police have subordinated but not abandoned the possibility that the hand of a woman scorned by Taylor fired the shot. They are concentrating on tracking down the shadowy unknown who lurked around the bungalow and, as they believe, dodged in, killed Taylor and escaped. One witness says she saw a man dressed in dark clothing and wearing a checkered cap, standing at the partly opened door of Taylor's bungalow and peering in. The housemaid of another neighbor saw a man running through an alley back of the house shortly after the report of a revolver was heard. This noise was ascribed at the time to an automobile blowout, but detectives are not satisfied it was the shot that ended Taylor's life. The unidentified man is described as roughly dressed. This may be a ruse to throw the police off the track of the slayer. Where men and women make their fortunes by impersonation, in the studios it is not improbable that they might resort to the expedient of a disguise to carry out a plan of vengeance. Whether the slayer, if it was a man who killed Taylor, acted in jealous rage because of attentions to a woman with whom he was infatuated, or did the bidding of a furious woman who later crept to the bungalow and peered, white- faced, upon the scene of the tragedy before slipping away again, are elements of the problem that face the investigators. These are all details they hope to bring to light in following through the maze through which Taylor passed in his endless search for beauty and which led him finally to his death. He was 50 years old. Beauty was the dominating impulse of his career. He sought for the beautiful in his pictures. It was this which brought him fame as the chief director of the Famous Players-Lasky corporation. It was his selection that brought the most beautiful of actresses into the pictures he directed. ...Taylor was a high liver and had many women friends. He was, according to general opinion in the motion picture colony, engaged for a time to Mary Miles Minter and later to Mabel Normand. A Mrs. Paul A. Crawford Ivers, continuity editor for Lasky's, is also reported to have been a friend of his. Taylor had been married twice, having been divorced both times. He was pre-eminently a man who kept the greater part of his life a mystery to those about him. Few men knew very much about his business interests which in a purely investment way and aside from his large earnings as chief motion picture director for the largest producing concern in the world, were extensive. Similarly he was a man of decided attraction for woman, but one who, in affairs of the heart as in everything else, played without making any noise...

Because of the variance in the descriptions of the man Mrs. MacLean saw and Sands, the police are inclined to drop any suspicion of this former valet, and they likewise place little credence in the robbery theory, as no material facts seem to support such a possibility. But some woman, they believe, is at the apex of the triangle, the other two points of which are a man with a revolver and William Desmond Taylor, noted Lasky director (deceased)...

Detectives admitted late today that they had under surveillance a prominent young man who might possibly be linked with the murder of William Desmond Taylor, prominent motion picture director, who was found shot to death in his luxurious apartments at 404-B South Alvarado street. The detectives have been watching this mysterious man all day. They would not divulge his name, but said that they were confident that he may have had something to do with the shooting of Taylor. If he tries to leave town, it is said, he will be taken into custody. An expert gunsmith, whose name was not divulged, has offered his services to Captain of Detectives David Adams. He is to take the bullet which was extracted from Taylor's body and by examination tell what kind of gun was used. The inquest will be held at 10 a.m. tomorrow, it was announced late today. The inquest was originally scheduled to be held at 1:30 p.m. Two witnesses, who were questioned today, and said to be very prominent in the motion picture world, declared they saw two men, one of whom answered the description of Edward Sands, loitering about the Taylor home some time before the shooting. The time of the shooting has been placed at between 7:45 p.m. and 8:15. Taylor's chauffeur told the detectives that he tried to call his employer at 8:15 on the night of the murder, and was unable to get him. He said he assumed that the director had stepped out. Detectives today were known to be quietly seeking a young New York broker, whose identity is being kept secret, to question him in an effort to bring to light more facts about the murder. This young man is said to have been prominent in movie society. He is described as a friend of a prominent movie actress. He came from the east, according to the story which detectives are investigating, shortly after the actress returned from a trip to New York, which she made some months ago. Detectives gave no intimation of what light they believed he might possibly shed on the mysterious slaying... Police detectives are concentrating today on the theory that Taylor probably was murdered by a 'love killer'--a man who resented Taylor's attention to some woman... A guest in the Dumas home next to Taylor said he saw two men last Monday night in the court yard. The men, the guest said, went to the door of Taylor's home, tried the door with a key, then walked away. One of these men, the police believe, is probably the murderer. Taylor's colored valet, Harry [sic] Peavey, who found the body, said that on several occasions Taylor had been annoyed by mysterious persons walking around his house. He said that on one occasion he asked Taylor why he didn't carry his gun. 'Somebody is liable to walk up those stairs when you're in your bedroom,' he said he told Taylor, 'and hold you up.' 'No, he won't,' Peavey said Taylor replied. 'I keep my gun on the bureau, and if I hear anyone walking up those stairs and he doesn't answer when I call him, he's a goner.' Peavey said Taylor did drive away these nocturnal visitors on several occasions at the point of a gun.... The newest clues, vague, but showing possibilities of untangling the mystery point to two or more unrequited loves for the murdered man. These women, beautiful, young and prominent, are said to have displayed affections for Taylor, who it is reported did not reciprocate. Tips over the telephone and by letter have come to the police station regarding the mystery slaying. So many angles of this case have developed that it is difficult to find any tangible clue that would lead to the discovery of the assassin....

If I had been engaged to marry Mr. Taylor, I would be only too proud to acknowledge it.' In such manner did Miss Mabel Normand, movie star, reiterate to me her denial of any engagement with William D. Taylor, the director, who was murdered Wednesday evening. Tears were in Miss Normand's eyes, her lithe body quivered and shook. She was under a terrible nervous strain. Her voice quavered and broke while she spoke of the dead man. 'I had known Mr. Taylor for years,' she continued, 'ever since I've lived at the Buckingham, but there never was any love affair existing between us--ever!' 'I loved Mr. Taylor as a good comrade--a pal with whom I could discuss subjects in which we were both mutually interested. For instance, I had been studying French and Mr. Taylor, who spoke French fluently, helped me tremendously. And, too, I have been somewhat interested in philosophy and metaphysics, and in those subjects he was again an invaluable teacher. 'I seldom saw Mr. Taylor, it's true, except at a gathering of friends. But frequently I conversed with him over the telephone. As a general rule merely to ask certain questions regarding the subjects I just mentioned. 'Wednesday evening was the first time I ever called upon Mr. Taylor alone. Then I stopped in for a few minutes on my way home in response to a message from Mr. Taylor left with my secretary. The message stated that Mr. Taylor already had sent one book I wanted to the house and had purchased another--one I wanted particularly--and had it at his place. It was for that book that I stopped by. 'I arrived about 7 o'clock and left at 7:45. He accompanied me to my car and talked to me a few minutes, laughingly criticizing my literary taste; there was a copy of the Police Gazette in the car and he thought it didn't very well fit in with Freud and Nietsche. 'After saying good night and promising to phone me within an hour, I directed William, my chauffeur, to drive me home. Being tired and having a studio call at 7:30 next morning, I retired to my room and within a few minutes I was in bed, where I had dinner served to me. That was about 8:15. Then I dropped off to sleep and slept until Edna Purviance phoned me the following morning the news of Mr. Taylor's death. 'Did I know that Mr. Taylor had been married? No. I don't know now that he was. People had told me, but I don't know if it was true. Mr. Taylor never discussed with me his private affairs; there was no reason for his doing so. 'I am so terribly shocked over this horrible tragedy I don't know what to do or say. It doesn't seem possible that anyone so lovable--a man who had so many friends and not a known enemy could have been so brutally killed. 'My one wish is that the murderer be apprehended and that punishment, however horrible, be meeted out to him.'

No, I never was engaged to marry William Desmond Taylor, I regret to say. 'No, I was not at his home on the night he was murdered. I was at my home reading a book. 'I had seen very little of him since we returned from Europe a year ago. 'He didn't have an enemy in the world. 'I am positive he was never married, because he would have told me so if he was. 'I love little Mabel Normand and I want the whole world to know that I love her, and appreciate her sterling qualities.' These were the outstanding statements regarding the mysterious murder of her former director, William Desmond Taylor, made by pretty Mary Miles Minter in an interview at her home last night. Curled up before the fireplace of her quaint adobe home with its soft lights and Spanish furnishings, the lovely blonde star was the center of an interested group of newspaper folk, who wished to employ her aid in solving the murder of the man so brutally slain. Miss Minter has a cold. She was exposed to a cold water bath in the filming of a picture last week, and is recuperating from her experience. But in an attractive dark frock that set off her blonde beauty and with golden hair, she was a pretty picture sitting before the crackling flames. Never in her varied but successful career has the screen star figured in a more interesting story than the one in which her former director lost his life. Miss Minter wants to help clear up the mystery and do all in her power to bring the slayer to justice. 'I could use every praiseworthy adjective in the English language to describe him,' she said, 'and still could not explain to you what a wonderful man he was. 'I had never met a man like him. He was loved by everyone who knew him. You just couldn't help trusting him. 'And everyone who ever had business dealings with him appreciated his kindness, consideration for others, his generosity. 'Just think,' the star broke down, 'here I was home, reading a book-- enjoying it so much--and he was lying there in his apartment, stone dead. 'Oh, I cannot believe that he has been murdered! 'Why, I went to his house this morning--mamma and I (pointing to her charming grandmother, Mrs. Mary Miles)--I always call grandma 'mamma' and mother 'mother'--and I couldn't believe he was dead! 'I loved him--of course not as--well, you know--but I loved him devotedly. He looked upon me more or less as a child, don't you know. And, although I saw a great deal of him before I went to Europe, after we got back we couldn't drag him away from his work, could we, mother?' the star asked her youthful parent, Mrs. Selby [sic], who smiled indulgently upon her pretty daughter. 'No,' said Mrs. Selby, 'he was more a hard worker. Really, he was more interested in his business than anything else. 'Do you know where his ex-wife and daughter are?' Miss Minter was asked. Miss Minter's violet colored eyes flashed fire. 'Why he had no wife--he was never married. I'm positive of that!' she replied. 'But, maybe Mary, he didn't tell you he was married,' broke in Mother. 'But mother, I knew him so well--I am sure he wasn't married. I asked him if he was, and he told me no. 'I don't think he was interested in women particularly,' said the star. 'I never was engaged to marry him--no, it wouldn't be fair to say that I was. Of course,' she laughed, 'every once in a while someone has me engaged to someone--they've had me engaged to eight men this year. 'You see he was nearly 50 years old--and although if I loved him and he was 75 I would marry him--but oh, no, there was nothing to that.' 'Had you heard of a romance between Mabel Normand and Mr. Taylor?' Miss Minter was asked. 'No, I hadn't,' she said, 'but I don't think there was anything to that. If it is true that he had asked to marry her, well I am glad that he and Mabel were such good friends. Mabel is a lovely girl. She is frank--if she wants to do anything she does it--that's why I admire Mabel. 'And she is big-hearted and noble of character. I love Mabel Normand.' 'When did you see Mr. Taylor last?' the actress was asked. 'Let's see,' she pondered. 'I hadn't seen dear old Mr. Taylor since before Christmas. In fact, I hadn't seen him in a year. Oh, yes, we passed him on the boulevard yesterday --just think, it was a few hours before he was murdered.' Miss Minter was almost in tears. 'Have they found his former valet?' she asked suddenly. She intimated that she believed Edward F. Sands was the villain, but she said: 'It would be unfair to accuse anyone of the crime. Maybe a crank or some demented person committed it. Did you see 'The Bat' at the Mason? There is a mystery story that would thrill you. You would sit on the edge of the seat while it is showing. I saw it in New York.'

Another tip in connection with the Taylor murder mystery 'blew up' at noon today. It was the clue that Edward Sands, former secretary and valet for the murdered man, was being held at the city jail. Upon investigation it was found that a Sands was in jail, but that his name is Edward W. Sands. He was arrested for petty larceny at a downtown department store and sentenced to serve 30 days in the city jail. Sands was given probation several years ago by Judge Craig after his conviction on a charge of grand larceny in connection with the alleged theft of automobile tires. He is now held at the county jail pending a hearing in Judge Reeve's court for violation of parole.

Henry Peavey, 40, of 127 1/2 East Third street, who found the body of William D. Taylor, famous motion picture director, found murdered in his home at 404B South Alvarado street, was scheduled to go to police court yesterday afternoon to face a charge of social vagrancy. Peavey, according to Patrolman S. G. White, was arrested, charged with being lewd and dissolute in Westlake park a few hours before his employer was murdered. Taylor, it is said, bailed the negro out. His case was taken off the calendar after Taylor's death. No date was set for the trial.

The seven detectives who are most actively engaged in hunting the murderer told the International News Service it is one of the most baffling cases in the annals of the local police department. It was stated that a complete probe will be made of Taylor's past life in an effort to get behind the veil of mystery surrounding the case and bring the slayer to justice. 'Wherever the trail leads, there will be detectives to follow,' said one police official. 'There will be no whitewashing of any person or any group of persons.' One of the foremost moving picture actresses was scheduled to be questioned late today regarding her asserted love for Taylor. While no suspicion rests on the woman, the police say, she may be able to throw a direct ray of light on some asserted love tangle in which Taylor may have been a principal. Among the various phases of the investigation was a report that Taylor had attended several so-called 'snow' parties, at which narcotics were served from tea wagons, for the purpose of obtaining local color for some of his pictures. The slaying, one detective pointed out, may have been an aftermath of such a party. Weird narratives of a mystic love cult also entered into the investigation when reports to the police linked Taylor's name with the strange life of the cult leaders. The weird love which was said to have existed as a part of the cult may have inspired one of the members to have caused Taylor's death, according to another detective who spent considerable time in delving into the mysticisms and entanglements of the asserted coterie... One of Taylor's closest friends, and a former business associate, told the International News Service this afternoon that he has arrived at the conclusion the director was killed at the instigation of a woman. 'I have been in touch with the police for 24 hours,' said this man, 'and I know the theories on which they have been working. They have now arrived at the belief he was murdered in a vengeance plot. 'I know Taylor was very friendly with one woman screen star. He gave her a farewell party last summer before he went to Europe. He took her to the Writers' Cramp, a notable entertainment recently given for the celebrities of 'movie' colony. 'The director and I had many conversations of a personal nature. But he was more or less of a man of mystery. I do not know that he had been friendly in recent months with any woman other than the screen actress, but it seems likely to me that a man of his engaging personality and magnetic charm should have attracted a number of women. 'Since I am positive that he had no business enemies, I am inclined to believe a woman's hand was at the bottom of it all and that the man who fired the shot was paid to do it.'

The names of two young film actresses and a man who has so far not figured in the case were linked by the police today in their investigation into the slaying of William Desmond Taylor, noted film director. The names of these persons are for the time being withheld by the police. The man, however, is known to have had a bitter quarrel with Taylor within the last month. He is under surveillance. Another man, who has already been questioned by the police, is also being watched and may again be quizzed before dawn tomorrow. The police are convinced that he has not told all he may know of circumstances surrounding the case. These facts are the outstanding ones today in the now famous murder mystery, known in police circles as the Taylor murder. It is calling forth the best efforts of seven detective sergeants, and many plainclothes officers. Subpenas for more than a half score of film stars and men prominent in the motion picture industry were served by police detectives today for the inquest at 1:30 o'clock tomorrow afternoon over the body of Taylor. Among those who will testify will be Mary Miles Minter, Douglas MacLean, Mabel Normand, Edna Purviance, Charles Eyton, Mrs. Douglas MacLean and Mrs. Julia Crawford Ivers. The inquest will be conducted by Coroner Nance and his chief assistant, William McDonald, in the mortuary of the Ivy H. Overholtzer undertaking establishment. Directly after Detective Sergeants Ziegler and Walls had left with the subpenas, Detective Sergeants Wood, Murphy, Herman Cline, Winn, Cato and Cahill left for separate places to run down clues that had been sent to Detective Capt. Dave Adams within the last 12 hours. These officers were to meet late today to report to Captain Adams the results of their quests. In the meantime it is known that two of the officers were questioning closely Taylor's chauffeur, in an effort to learn the places he had taken the film director during the last few weeks that might reveal some clew as to the identity of possible enemies... One important fact was brought out by Detective Sergeant Herman Cline, opening up theories of possible robbery as motive. It was known to several friends that on Wednesday Taylor had in his possession in gold and currency $2300. He had intended putting this money in the bank the following day, but for some unknown reason he visited the bank late Wednesday and deposited the money. It is the belief of Sergeant Cline that if robbery was the motive the burglar after firing the shot became frightened that the noise might have aroused some persons in the neighborhood, and fled without attempting to steal anything... Several things have been discovered in Taylor's past, the officers say, that may assist in solving the mystery. The police today were close on the trail of a man who three hours before the murder made inquiries in the neighborhood as to the location of Taylor's home... Taylor was a man who possessed great nerve and coolness under any circumstances. Friends say he probably would have refused to obey the order of a burglar to hold up his hands. Such being the case, it is possible according to the robbery theory that the burglar fired the one shot that ended the man's life... An investigation was also put under way to determine whether or not the mysterious telephone calls frequently received by Taylor might lead to the identity of the murderer. The director, his friends say, often told of the calls in the night. When he answered there was no answer, it is said. This phase of the situation, however, the police believe, indicates that some one laid careful plans for the murder of the director and had long borne a grudge against him...

Miss Edna Purviance, who lived in the two-story bungalow adjoining the home of William D. Taylor, the Lasky film director who was shot Wednesday night, said that when she returned to her home some time near midnight Wednesday she noticed lights burning in Mr. Taylor's house, but that as Mr. Taylor was given to burning the midnight oil, being a great reader, she thought nothing of it. 'I was awakened,' said Miss Purviance last night, 'early Thursday morning by the terrifying voice of some one who seemed to be running up and down the court, screaming, 'Mr. Taylor is dead! Mr. Taylor is dead!' I looked out the window and saw his Negro boy Henry, who was almost frantic with grief, as he was very much attached to Mr. Taylor. 'Before they found the bullet wound in Mr. Taylor's back they thought he had died of heart disease, and that seemed terrible enough, but when we learned he had been murdered, almost at our own door, it seemed too horrible to believe. 'I knew Mr. Taylor only very slightly. I had never worked with him and had only met him to a purely formal social way. I thought him to be a very interesting, likable, discerning gentleman, with gallant, polished manners and a brilliant intellect. 'I always heard him spoken of as a man with a reputation above reproach and a nature that was kind and generous. Although living as a near neighbor,I saw him very infrequently and knew nothing of his private life or of his love affairs, if he had any. I knew that he and Miss Normand were good friends but knew nothing of heart interest on either side.'

Film Director Is Slain at Desk; Murderer Stands Behind Chair W. D. Taylor Found Mysteriously Murdered in Los Angeles Was Scanning Canceled Checks When Shot Mabel Normand, Last Visitor, Says He Feared Former Servant. Thrice "Friendly Burglar's" Victim. Los Angeles. Feb. 2 (By the Associated Press). Mystery tonight surrounded the murder of William Desmond Taylor, internationally known motion picture director, who was found dead at his desk in his home here this morning. The bullet which ended his life had been fired into his neck from behind and had ranged downward, piercing his heart. On the desk beside his head lay a mass of canceled checks which he apparently had been inspecting when the fatal shot was fired. Robbery, according to the police, could not have been the motive, for nothing was missing from the apartment although a considerable sum of money and jewelry was found undisturbed near the body. Told Actress of Fear. One of the last persons to see Tayfor, who was director in chief at the Famous Players-Lasky studios, alive was Mabel Normand, fil comedienne. She called upon him early yesterday evening. She told detectives today that she stopped at the apartment to return a book Taylor had loaned her and talked with him for about half an hour. She said Taylor expressed fear of a former servant who, he alleged, robbed him. She also said Taylor had told her he might call at her home several blocks away, later in the evening and that he might telephone." Miss Normand left the apartment about 9 oclock, she said, this statement being corroborated by her chauffeur. Both said Tayior walked to the car with her. She said she had not seen or heard from him again. Taylor 's only servant, who left the apartments at the same time as the actress last night, found the body on returning this morning. The servant said both front and dear doors of the apartment were looked when he arrived. The front door opens upon a court, even with the street level, from which anyone could have entered the apartment if it were unlocked. with little chance of being observed. The door has a spring lock. Seeking Former Servant. Most of the early efforts of the investigators today were directed to an attempt to locate the former servant of Taylor 's, against whom the motion picture man had lodged a complaint with the police some time ago. Tayfor declared the man had stolen some I of his belongings and forged his name to a check. and that he believed a burglary of his apartment some time alter was committed by the same person. The wife of a motion picture actor living in the same group of apartments said that she saw a man standing at the door of Taylor 's place about 8 oclock last night. She said is he appeared to have the door partly open and to be looking in. She described the man as short and stockily built and wearing a checkered cap. This description does not tally with that of the former servant. Left Miss Normand There. Harry Peavey. Taylors negro servant, told the police that he left the apartment, according to his custom, at about 7:30 o'clock last night. He said that Miss Normand was still there at that time, having arrived while he was serving dinner about half an hour earlier. The police made it plain that they had no suspicion as far as Miss Normand was concerned, but questioned her merely in looking I for possible clews in all available quarters. When Taylor 's body was first found, it was thought that he had died from a hemorrage, so slight was the wound in his neck left by the passage of the is bullet. After this wound was discovered. search was begun for the pistol which fired the shot. but it could not be found. Nothing in the apartment was disturbed, the slayer, apparently, having fined without leaveing a single clew behind. Miss Normand was said by the police to have received her first word of the tragedy through Edaa Purviance. also a motion picture actress, whose apartment is near that occupied by Taylor. Miss Purviance called Miss Normand on the telephone as soon as she heard the details of the shooting. The police were said to be considering the possibility that Taylor was shot by the discarded suitor of some, woman with whom he had been friendly; by a former servant he had, caused to be arrested for an alleged crime and who was said to have threatened his life; by a burglar who was surprised when Taylor returned is from escorting Miss Normand to her care, or possibly by a woman who, for it some unknown reason, had become enraged at him. Miss Normand stated tonight there "had been no affair of the heart whatever" between her and Taylor. "His friendship for me was that of an older man for a girl who liked the outdoor sports he liked, and who was eager to glean a little enlightenment from the vast storehouse of knowledge he possessed." For several months it had been rumored, but never confirmed, that Miss Normand was engaged to marry Taylor. The detectives expressed the belief is the director was slain by a man, basing their theory on statements made by Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of a film actor, and her maid, that they had seen a stranger about the Taylor apartments both before and after is neighbors heard a shot. Taylors career Adventurous. Taylor had an adventurous career. which included three trips to Alaska. during one of which he wrested was a small fortune from the Klondike, He served during the world war with they British army having been born in Ireland, and within a few months rose from the ranks of a private to a captain. He was trained for the engineering profession, but turned to the stage when 18 years old. He left the stage to join the first rush to Alaska. Taylor had been director -in-chief of I the Famous Players-Lasky plant in Hollywood. Tells of "Friendly" Robber New York. Feb. 2. William Desmond Taylor, motion picture director for the Famous Payers-Lasky Corporation, whose body, with a bullet through the heart, was found in his home in Loss Angeles today. twice in eight months had been the victim of a "friendly" robber, who promised to return again, according to E. W. Wingart, a friend, who has just returned from California. While Mr. Taylor was in England last May valuable jewelry, clothes and $800 in cash were taken from his apartment, Mr. Wingart said. Last Christmas week the apartment was entered again, the burglar leaving pawn checks for the jewelry and clothes previously stolen, and making off with more clothes and jewelry He left a note addressed to Taylor, which said: "Merry Christmas, shall return again.

MOVIE DIRECTOR FOUND MURDERED IN LOS ANGELES William Desmond Taylor of The Famous Players is Shot Dead in His Home. JEALOUSY MAY BE MOTIVE Police Working on That Theory, as No Attempt Was Made to Take Money or Valuables. HEAR SHOT, HOUR IN DOUBT Mabel Normand Tells of Leaving him Alive at 9 o'Clock After Conference on New Production. Spectal to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES, Feb, 2.- Los Angeles was shocked by another murder mystery today when the body of William Desmond Taylor, chief director of the Famous Players-Lasky studios, was found in his home with a bullet shot through his heart. Henry PeaVey a negro serwant, when he arrived this morning at the home where Taylor lived alone, found the body lying beside a desk, where Taylor had been going over a number of canceled checks he had received yesterday from the bank. Following a preliminary inquiry the police questioned Mabel Normand, the film actress. She and others were at Taylor's home at about 8:30 o'clock last night. Miss Normand said that she visited Taylor's bungalow early in the evening to discuss a new production, and that he escorted her to her automobile at the curb shortly before 9 o'clock. Taylor was to telephone to her later in the evening, Miss Normand said, but did not do so. It has been rumored for some months that Miss Normand was engaged to marry Taylor, but the rumors have never been confirmed. Conflicting Stories on Shot. Conflicting stories were told to the police as to the time of the shooting. According to Douglas McLean, who lives near by, he heard the shot at 9 o'clock. Another report was that the shooting occurred about 2 o'clock in the morning. Miss Edna Purviance, who lives in a house adjoining the Taylor bungalow, returned home about midnight last night and at that time, she said, saw a light burning in Taylor 's apartment, but thought nothing of it. Miss Purviance and Miss Normand were talking over the telephone this morning when Taylor's colored servant found the body and shouted "Murder! Murder!" McLean and his wife, who live near the Taylor home, stated that they heard a shot fired shortly after 9 o'clock. They described a strange man whom they saw in the street. The neighbors who heard the report believed it the backfire of an automobile, and they observed nothing in Bungalow Court, in which the Taylor residence is situated, that would lead them to believe there had been an unusual occurrence. The slayer evidently entered the house and shot Taylor as he was working on his check book. The moving picture director dropped to the floor and death was caused by an internal hemorrhage. Taylor's revolver was found in a drawer of the dresser in his bedroom on the second floor. It had not been discharged and none of his personal-effects had been disturbed. His jewelry, which was valued at several thousand dollars, was found in one of the dresser drawers by detectives. Tracing the movements of the suspected slayer, investigators last night located three witnesses who saw the man before and after the tragedy. Just after the report of the revolver was heard, Mrs. MacLean saw a man leaving the Taylor apartments. He was described as being about five feet nine or ten inches tall, medium built, roughly but not shabbily dressed in dark clothes and a plaid cap. Shortly before 6 o'clock a man answering this description stopped at the Hartley service station, corner of Sixth and Alvarado Strests, and inquired where W D. Taylor resided. Floyd Hartley, 331 South Bonnie Brae Avenue, and L. A. Grant, in charge of the station, were in the place at the time. Women acquaintances of the director will be questioned. The theory the police are working on is that a jealous woman either shot Taylor or had him shot. That a woman actually did the slaying is the more generally accepted theory. Taylor Accused Secretary. The police records show that when Taylor went to England a year ago on a business and pleasure trip he left his secretary, Edward F. Sands, in charge of his personal affairs. and that when he returned he reported to Detective Sergeants Herman Cline and E. R. Cato, that Sands had robbed him of money, jewelry, clothing and a valuable automobile. A felony warrant was issued for Sands and the police say he was never found. A second robbery at the Taylor residence was attributed to Sands by the police. Robbery was evidently not the motive of the crime. A purse containing $78 was found lying in the desk beside the body and the slayer had made no efforts to take any articles from the house. When the body was found the neighbors called the Central Police station, and policemen who visited the scene turned in a report that Taylor had died as the result of hemorrhage, lt was not until Deputy Coroner William McDonald made a close inspection of the body that the bullet wound was discovered. The bullet had struck just below the neck on the left side and ranged downward through the heart. From the position of the wound, the detectives believe that Taylor was shot from behind. Among the mute evidences of what had taken place in the home before Taylor was shot is an expensive silver and cut glass drinking service. On it was a decanter, a shaker used in mixing drinks and two large glasses. In the glasses was some orange pulp, apparently left from an orange and gin concoction. A tray was littered with cigarette stubs. This service was found on the dining room table. The body was found in an adjoining room. Statement by Miss Normand. LOS ANGELES,, Cal., Feb. 2. "When I went to Mr. Taylor's home Wednesday evening, it was in response to a telephone call he had made to mine," Miss Normand said tonight. "I had my chaufffur drive me to Mr. Taylor 's home. I bought peanuts and some magazines and newspapers and ate the peanuts on the way. When I got out of my automobile I told any chauffeur to clean the car. Then I went up the steps. I heard Mr. Taylor talking to somebody over the phone, underreath the stairs, and I hesitated about going in until he had finished. Then I entered. He had been talking to a woman who had charge of the income tax business for many of the picture folk, including myself. He came in and said: 'Gee, I am glad to see you.' 'It was about five minutes after seven when I arrived at his house. We talked about books. I am studying French, and as he spoke French fluently, he was of great assistance to me. "I looked around the drawing room and told him I thought he had changed his house furnishilgs. He said: 'You haven 't been here for so long you forget.' I hadn't been to his house before for two months. He said: 'The phonograph is the only thing new.' "His servant, Henry, came in, and I said to Mr. Taylor: 'Have you had your dinner?' He said: 'Yes: have you had yours?' I said, 'No, but I'm tired and am going home now. I have a studio call for 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.' "He went with me to my car. He expressed surprise at some of the magazines in my car, and some were light, I suppose, and he gave me one of Freud 's books to read. He said he would phone me later in the evening to see how I liked it, but he did not. That was the last I ever heard his voice. When Edna Purviance told me this morning he was dead. I felt sure it was all some horrible mistake. I had known him for six or seven years. He was uniformly kind to every one." News of the death of Taylor stirred the motion picture colony here, and a group of directors and others prominent in the industry met tonight to consider offering a reward for the arrest and conviction of his slayer. Some of the efforts of the police tonight were directed to a search for the person who some time before Taylor's death wrote him a note enclosing pawn tickets for jewelry stolen from his home. The note apparently was written in Sacramento, Cal., Dec. 27, 1921. It read: "So sorry to inconvenience you, even temporarily. Also observe the lesson of the forced sale of assets. "A merry Christmas and a happy and prosperous New Year. (Signed) "ALIAS JIMMIE V." Mrs. Marjorie Berger, said to be an income tax expert, told the police, they stated, that Taylor had told her he had been receiving "mysterious" telephone calls. "Why don't you get somebody to watch?" Mrs. Berger said she asked him. that the Oh, no," she said Taylor replied, but did not explain his aversion to the procedure she had suggested. The theory of the police that a man lurked around the apartment until an opportunity presented itself for him to kill Tayier was said tonight to be reinforced by the discovery of six cigarette stubs in the alley adjoining the apartment. On a writing desk near the door of Taylor 's room were papers which indicated that Taylor had been preparing his income tax returns. On top of the desk was a picture of Miss Normand, and two others of the same actress were found in a conspicuous place in the apartment. Photographs of Mary Pickford and Mary Miles Minter also were in the apartment. Taylor had directed both of them. Soon after the death of Taylor became generally known, Miss Minter and her mother hurried to the apartment to learn if they could be of any assistance. Miss Minter was crying when she arrived, it was reported. Well known as Director. William D. Taylor was one of the best known motion-picture directors in this country. For several years he had been on the Hollywood staff of the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation. and was responsible for a number of that company's productions. His most favorably received work, perhaps, was his screen version of "Huckleberry Finn," which was first shown in New York at the Rivoli Theatre in February, 1920. He also directed Mary Pickford, when she was an Artcraft star, in. "Johanna Enlists" and "Captain Kidd Jr." Among the later pictures directed by him were several in which Mary Miles Minter was the principal player including "Judy of Rogues Harbor," "Nurse Marjorie" and "Jenny Be Good, "and two in which Ethel Clayton was the star, "Wealth" and "Beyond." He also directed "Sacred and Profane Love," with Elsie Ferguson in the leading role: "The Witching Hour," with Elliott Dexter at the head of the cast" "The Soul of Youth," featuring Lewis Sargent, and "The Furnace."
