Located by the EXAMINER late last night and questioned until midnight by Deputy Sheriff Harvey Bell and George Pross, manager of the Burns Detective Agency, the wealthy young New Yorker, who had been engaged to a motion picture star frequently mentioned in connection with the William D. Taylor murder mystery, gave an account of himself, which, in the opinion of the officers, practically eliminates him from consideration. The examination of the young man occurred in a downtown hotel and was of special interest because of his close attentions to two of the actresses most conspicuous in the social life of Taylor. He was able, state the officers, to account for every hour of his time on the night of the murder. Interest had centered in this picturesque character for several days, largely because he was known as the rejected suitor of the star who, herself, was said to be infatuated with Taylor. Police and sheriff's officers were instructed to find this man, who had checked out from the fashionable hotel where he was a guest on Wednesday afternoon and, apparently, had disappeared. Information coming to THE EXAMINER late yesterday afternoon enabled one of its representatives to locate him. He was found in his room at a downtown hotel and his interrogation followed. His elimination is regarded by the police as one of the most important contributions to the case in that it removes a possibility which had engaged the efforts of several officers, and thus narrows the field in which investigation must be prosecuted.

If Peavey, his colored servant, says that I had asked him about any girls that Mr. Taylor had ever been interested in, it is a venomous fabrication. Never in my life have I spoken to this man directly, and never have I talked to him in any way except in the presence of others, including Mr. Taylor. And as for the subject of girls--the question never entered my mind.' [5]

...The visit of Mr. Eyton to the Detective Bureau was for the purpose of aiding in the search for Sands. Several witnesses who know the fugitive say they saw him in Los Angeles about the time of the shooting. At least two persons believe they saw him on the night of the shooting. One woman saw Sands within a block of the Taylor home within less than two hours of the time set for the murder. Capt. Adams in a statement to newspaper men declared that the entire case hinges on Sands. 'If we can locate Sands,' declared Capt. Adams, 'then we will be able once and for all to settle the question of his whereabouts on the night of the murder. If Sands cannot prove to our satisfaction where he was on Wednesday night between 7 and 8 o'clock we will then believe that we have found the right man.' ...Several women and three men, all of whom know Sands by sight, say that they saw him on the streets of the city during the last month. ...Police say Sands has lost some weight since he fled after the first robbery.

Julia Crawford Ivers, scenarist for the late William D. Taylor, yesterday gave out the following statement: 'Today the friends of William D. Taylor, and they are legion, will gather to pay the last tribute to the man they love, to one who as man, director and friend measured 100 per cent. 'I have worked side by side with this man for seven years. We have solved many difficult problems together, sometimes pleasant, sometimes unpleasant: always hard, trying nerve-wracking. And during all these years of close association I have never known him to do one unkind, one ungenerous act, but I have known hundreds of instances of open-handed generosity and in most cases the beneficiary never knew whom to thank. 'This man whose loyalty and honor were without question, who takes with him the undying gratitude of the thousands to whom he has lent a helping hand--this man who stood for everything that was fine and clean in pictures, who is known to have declared that if it were necessary to his success to produce unclean pictures he would go back to the white, clean snows of Alaska and dig his living out of the ground--this man was shot in the back by a cowardly assassin. He was given no opportunity to defend himself and William D. Taylor would have defended himself, for he did not know the meaning of the word fear. And more cowardly than the assassin's bullet, lodged in the heart of this dear man, is the tongue of scandal, which safely sheltered behind his dead body, is striking at his reputation--more cowardly for he is powerless to defend himself. 'His friends know that when it is all over the character of Mr. Taylor will stand, as it always has stood, for everything that is fine and worth while. 'The good book says, 'Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.' And it is recorded that no stones were cast.'

...Dr. H. M. S. Maddock, who was the examining physician for the Canadian recruiting mission throughout the period of the war, and who is a Los Angeles resident, examined William Desmond Taylor for Canadian [British] army service. Facts obtained from Dr. Maddock concerning William Desmond Taylor's enlistment coincide with the records of W. D. Taylor found in the London War Office. The London dispatch states the enlistment of W. D. Taylor of 1127 Orange Street, Los Angeles, was attested to in Chicago, July 3, 1918. Dr. Maddock, though he does not remember the date, stated last night that it was a very hot day in July, 1918, when William Desmond Taylor entered the recruiting office in the San Fernando Building for his medical examination. 'I remember the man well,' he said. 'I did not usually examine personally, the recruits. Most of them were ordinary men, such as we see daily on the streets, many shabbily dressed. Mr. Taylor was different from the ordinary man, so I examined him personally. He was a man of fine physique for his age, one of the best physical specimens I had yet seen. 'Mr. Taylor, as was the rule, was then sent to San Francisco for a second examination. He did not accompany the other recruits, whose railroad fare was always paid by the recruiting mission. He paid his own fare to San Francisco and went alone. No one had accompanied him to the Los Angeles recruiting office on the day of his enlistment. He was alone. 'The war record shows he was entered into the service at Chicago on July 3, 1918, I am told. That is not unusual for the recruits, after passing examinations at San Francisco, were sent either to Vancouver or to Chicago for their final medical examinations. At the place where this third medical examination is passed, the recruit is then taken into the service. I think Mr. Taylor went to Chicago.'

A gracious tribute to the memory of William D. Taylor, murdered director, was paid yesterday, in an interview by Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. 'The most patient man I ever knew,' Mrs. Fairbanks said, and her husband added. 'We all knew him as a gentleman of whom the film industry might well be proud.' 'We were horribly shocked,' Mrs. Fairbanks said, 'to learn of his death and we simply refuse to believe the innuendos against his character. Neither of us were intimate friends of his, but he had directed me and we naturally were well acquainted. 'Both as a gentleman and as an artist I respected him. 'He was ever courteous, considerate, and above all, patient. It's pretty hard directing all sorts of people in big pictures, members of the casts often being temperamental and even stubborn. He never had a harsh word to say to anyone and would spend all sorts of time and energy to get just the artistic results he wanted. 'To me and to everyone who ever mentioned him to me, he was always the quiet, reserved, artistic gentleman. The films could not have lost a more valuable or more beloved member and I cannot deplore too much the fact of the tragedy or the attendant notoriety. 'We are hardly ever out and have our own small circle of friends, and so about his private life we know nothing. But it seems a shame that these girls should have to be linked up with such a ghastly crime. Although I know none of them well, I have always heard of them as nice, well thought of citizens.' To this statement Douglas Fairbanks added only that he had met Taylor a few times and though not an intimate of his, knew of him as a man of the highest caliber and a man who was ever trying to make of the films something finer and better.

In order to refute the statement by wire from her aunt, Mrs. John Ketcham of Buffalo, N. Y., Mrs. Ada Deane-Tanner of Monrovia, divorced wife of Dennis Deane-Tanner, stated in detail yesterday numerous points and occurrences which preclude the possibility of William Deane-Tanner and Dennis Deane-Tanner being one and the same man. 'It was just a few days after the birth of my first little daughter, Muriel, in 1908, that I first saw William Deane-Tanner, my husband's brother. He came out to see his new niece and while there was a resemblance in the two men it was not so striking that they could have been taken for each other under any circumstances. My husband was about five feet nine inches in height while his brother was over six feet tall and the brother wore a mustache at that time and my husband was smooth shaven. My husband had had his nose broken while at college when engaging in strenuous athletic sports and this gave his face an identity that could not be mistaken. 'William Deane-Tanner disappeared about a year after I saw him and my husband grieved terribly over the strange occurrence and missed his brother very much. I went to see his wife at the time. She was a very beautiful blonde with light golden hair and the most perfect skin and very slender. She seemed perfectly dazed with wonder as to why he had left her. 'I was married in 1907 and for five years my husband was everything that the most exacting or the most idealistic wife could demand or desire. He was tender, thoughtful, generous, patient, clean-minded and the soul of honor. Suddenly I was taken ill and the doctor said I must be sent to California. This distressed my husband so that we decided to try the Adirondacks first to see if the mountain air there would not bring me back to health and strength. So my husband helped me pack, looked after every arrangement for the trip and took me and our two little children up to a comfortable, picturesque house in the mountains and then went back to his business. in a few days I got a big express package with some heavier flannels for me and an immense box of candy, all tied up with fancy ribbons. 'William Deane-Tanner was called 'Petie' by his intimate associates in New York. I do not know who gave him the name and I do not think the brothers saw each other often. My husband did not come out with his brother when he came to see me as he was at his place of business and could not leave. But there was no possibility of their being the same man. 'That was the last communication I ever received from my husband. He never wrote a line to me after leaving me there and I never saw him again. This was nearly four years after the disappearance of his brother. After his brother left, his mother and sister, in London, with whom I corresponded, often wrote of how they were grieving over William's strange dropping from sight. His mother said she was sure he must be dead or that she would hear from him. When my husband disappeared and I wrote them they never answered my letters and though I wrote a number of times I have never heard from them again and lost track of them. 'It is true that my husband had the same fits of despondency that William is said to have had. He would have depressed, gloomy spells that I could neither account for nor make him shake off. He rarely spoke of his people in England, but I merely attributed that to the characteristic reticence of the English to discuss their affairs and I never had any reason to suspect that there was any tragedy or skeleton in the family that he was hiding. 'The only other time I ever saw William Deane-Tanner was when I went to ask him if he had ever seen or heard from my husband. He was so very stern and repelling and acted so like a man of stone that I was chilled and hurt, but I wrote to him and told him the reasons and proof by which I knew he was the man I claimed him to be. It was after that that he began sending me the allowance. The way I came to hear of him being out here friends of mine in New York saw him on the screen and recognized his face and learned that he was now a director at Lasky's. 'His sister's name was Mrs. Eaudel-Phillips and I gathered that they were people of independent means though not extremely wealthy. Both my husband and his brother were educated at Clifton and were then sent to Germany and France to finish their education and my husband spoke both French and German fluently.' Mrs. Deane-Tanner spoke of little mannerisms that the brothers had in common, such as holding a cigarette in a peculiar way, and of tossing the head back. She said that in disposition and temperament, in education, tastes and habits they were much the same, and she stated that although her husband saw but little of his brother, he was very deeply attached to him, and that after the brother's disappearance her husband grew more and more moody.

A chauffeur employed by the Yellow Taxicab Company last night gave officers investigating the murder of William Desmond Taylor, slain film director, what was regarded as one of the hottest leads thus far uncovered in the attempts to solve the mystery of the fatal shooting last Wednesday night. This chauffeur, who was taken in tow at once by Detective Sergeants King, Cato and Cahill, is named Meister and is reported to have taken a party from the vicinity of the shooting soon after the slaying. He was accompanied on his trip to the detective bureau by Sidney Glover, an official of the taxicab company. Captain of Detective Adams declined to discuss the new phase of the case. Earlier in the day he talked with the two new witnesses. They were not to be found last night, and were declared to be with the two detective sergeants. Several new angles in the investigation were opened up yesterday by deputy sheriffs working under the personal direction of Sheriff Traeger, Undersheriff Biscailuz and Criminal Superintendent Al Manning. While Mr. Manning refused to disclose what lines the Sheriff's investigation is taken, he admitted his officers, Deputies Harvey Bell and Fox and Nolan, were following leads that have developed new aspects of the murder mystery. 'I cannot state at this time what we are working on, but the information uncovered by this office is very significant and is vital to the solution of the crime,' Mr. Manning said late last night. Centering their efforts on finding Edward F. Sands, suspect in the investigation of the murder, detectives on the case yesterday followed several clews while Captain of Detective Adams held secret conferences with at least four important witnesses... Twice during the day all the detectives working on the case were called together in conference with Capt. Adams. They all declared they are concentrating their efforts toward finding Sands, the former employee of Mr. Taylor and an asserted robber and forger for whose arrest Mr. Taylor swore out a warrant. Few definite concrete developments were noticeable as a result of the day's activities. Further facts concerning the past and mysterious life of the slain man were uncovered. Many supposed clews were checked by the officers and found valueless. Charles Eyton, manager for the Famous Players-Lasky studio, where Mr. Taylor, a director of international reputation, was under contract, held a long talk with Capt. Adams. Henry Peavey, negro houseman who discovered the body of his employer, also was a visitor at the police station. Late in the day it was declared by the officers that missing letters known to have been kept by Mr. Taylor shortly before his death have an important bearing, in their belief, on the case. Among these letters were several written by Mabel Normand, film star, to Mr. Taylor. Everyone questioned by Capt. Adams concerning the letters has denied having them or removing them from the Taylor apartment on South Alvarado street, where his body was found last Thursday morning. Mr. Eyton, who was one of the first outsiders called to the scene, again yesterday said he had not seen them. Miss Normand last Saturday called at the house for her letters. She has not seen those which she wrote. Public Administrator Bryson, who has charge of the estate, says he has not seen them. The District Attorney's Office makes similar avowal. The visit of Mr. Eyton to the Detective Bureau was for the purpose of aiding in the search for Sands. Several witnesses who know the fugitive say they saw him in Los Angeles about the time of the shooting. At least two persons believe they saw him on the night of the shooting. One woman saw Sands within a block of the Taylor home within less than two hours of the time set for the murder... The investigation has simmered down to a process of elimination, with the finding of Sands as the first obstacle. Hundreds of theories, tips and clews have been investigated, weighed and discarded or added to the chain of circumstances being assembled by the detectives. During the day, representatives of Mabel Normand, who was the last friend who saw Mr. Taylor alive last Wednesday, called at the police station to tell the detectives that Miss Normand was going to have her telephone number changed to avoid the continual stream of calls made for her recently. The pink silk nightgown--a delicate, lacy piece of woman's lingerie-- that was found in the bachelor apartments of the slain man yesterday held attention of many persons. The garment was one of several formerly at the house, according to the statement of a former employee, and was there during the six months Peavey worked there. Employees preceding Peavey declared that the silken things so strange to a man's wardrobe were used occasionally, or at least were taken from their accustomed places, unfolded and replaced. Reports were circulated during the day that the owner of the night dress had been identified as an actress friend of the dead man. No official confirmation of this could be obtained. The garment, known to have been at the home on the morning the body was found, was not available for public scrutiny. The comment made by Mr. Eyton regarding the missing letters was as follows: 'I have taken no letters from Mr. Taylor's home the day the body was found, nor have I taken any, or had any letters given me by anyone since. There were a number of papers and documents there. I watched the representative of the Public Administrator's office sort the papers. It was more than a half-hour after the body was found that I arrived there. In the meantime scores of persons went through the house.' Mr. Eyton joined Capt. Adams and Public Administrator Bryson in the opinion that if any of Mabel Normand's letters were taken away from the Taylor home, they were taken by the man who killed Taylor or by some friend of Miss Normand who wanted to return them to the comedy star. 'I have no interest in any of these letters,' Mr. Eyton continued. 'If I had them I would turn them over to the police, because I am interested only in one thing, and that is the capture of the man who murdered 'Bill' Taylor, my friend. I hardly think, however, that there was anything in the missing letters that would be of any assistance in the search for the slayer.'... Several women and three men, all of whom knew Sands by sight, say that they saw him on the streets of the city during the last month. None of them spoke to him and several of them under close questioning by the police admit that they may have been mistaken...

When William Desmond Taylor, noted film director, was shot to death in his South Alvarado street apartment last Wednesday night, he was standing with his arms lifted over his head and a .38-caliber revolver pressed against his side, some six inches below his left armpit and toward the back. Such is the new theory of the police advanced yesterday for the first time. They base their belief on a careful examination made yesterday of the clothing worn by the noted motion picture man when he fell, mortally wounded, to the floor of his living-room, about 8 o'clock Wednesday night. In a conference of the detectives working on the case, including Police Detective King of the District Attorney's office as well as the officers detailed from the detective bureau, a minute inspection of the garments was made. The hole through which the bullet entered was powder-marked. The marking was of such a nature that they decided conclusively he was shot by a revolver held pressed against his coat. By comparing the entrance of the bullet in the coat, and in the vest, a remarkable new fact was disclosed. The holes do not correspond in location when the coat is adjusted normally about the wearer. But when the arm was raised the hole in the coat was brought up to the corresponding hole in the vest. This fact led to the definite conclusion of the investigators that when Mr. Taylor was shot down he knew he was being attacked, that he was compelled to hold his arms overhead by the assailant. The discovery of the new-found facts did not change the police theory that the slayer slipped into the house by the front door while Mr. Taylor was absent for a few minutes. At that time he was escorting Miss Mabel Normand, celebrated film actress, to her automobile, after she had made a short call for the purpose of getting a book. During the temporary absence of Mr. Taylor, the assassin stepped quickly into the house and crouched behind the door, the police believe. From this position he had the drop on the film director when the latter re-entered and closed the door. That he ordered Mr. Taylor to put up his hands is now the belief of the officers. And while the victim was standing in this position he was shot to death, probably after a conversation, if the slaying was done for revenge. Some of the officers believe the shot could have made the same entrance holes in the coat and vest if Mr. Taylor was bending over to seize a chair at his writing desk in order to defend himself against the intruder. To support this belief they point to the overturned chair found in the apartment--the only suspicion that an attempted struggle was staged. To verify the belief the revolver was pressed against the coat when fired, Detective King took some of the clothing and experimented with shots fired from various distances. This confirmed the theory, he said. The piece of lead which penetrated Mr. Taylor's lung and all but went completely through his body was positively identified as having been fired from a .38-caliber, short, soft-nosed cartridge. This type of shell is commonly used, although it will not fit an automatic weapon.

In William D. Taylor's effects two love letters, written in a school- girl code, were found. One of them is reproduced above. It is a code familiar to thousands of youngsters. The letter reads as follows. 'I love you--oh, I love you so. 'I had to come down because mama remarked that I always seemed to feel rather happy after being out with you. So here I am. Camouflage. 'Furthermore, I am feeling unusually fine (more camouflage). I will see you later. God love you as I do.'

The story of a wonderful love. A young girls' adoration beating its timorous wings under the shadow of impending calamity. When a carefully treasured letter fluttered from the pages of a book, Thursday, it revealed a love idyll charming in its conception, dramatic in its development, peculiarly sad in its unfullfilment. The love story of Mary Miles Minter and William Desmond Taylor. Out of the cloud of circumstances brought to light by the murder of the famous director shines the clear ray of this remarkable romance between the cultured, dignified man of 50 and the beautiful ingenue of 19. In the search of Mr. Taylor's effects, conducted the morning after he met his mysterious death, chance played a freakish role. The examination virtually had been concluded. One of the investigators, selecting a book from the case at random, idly fluttered the pages. Out dropped a letter. He picked it up and found it to be an ingenuous love letter written on heavily embossed stationery. 'Dearest: I love you--I love you--I love you,' it read. And below this reiterated sentence appeared a line of crosses followed by a single cross, heroic in size. At the end it said, 'Yours always. Mary.' And on the wings and body of the butterfly crest appeared the words, 'Mary Miles Minter.' Miss Minter did not deny the authorship of the letter. 'I did love William Taylor,' she said. 'I loved him deeply and tenderly, with all the admiration and respect a young girl gives to a man with the poise and culture of Mr. Taylor.'...

Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill last night were questioning one of the most widely known motion picture actresses in the entire profession, expecting to secure vital information upon what several of the investigators believe to be the overshadowing theory in the William D. Taylor case. This theory is that a man who was in love with the actress in question, having the motive of jealousy, may have acted in response to the promptings of a wounded heart. Six headquarters men spent more than two yours late yesterday afternoon receiving the details of a story believed to be of great possible significance from C. M. Meister, a driver for the Yellow Taxicab Company. Meister was brought to police headquarters by S. Cooper, assistant general manager of the company. The narrative was, in substance, as follows: 'On last Wednesday night at 10:55 o'clock I picked up four passengers at 620 South Broadway--two men and two women. 'Upon entering the cab one of the men pulled up the window between themselves and me, apparently, so that I might not overhear their conversation. 'I drove them to a number in the Wilshire district. (The Examiner is in possession of this number, but is withholding it for the present at the request of the police.) 'One of the men and the two women left the cab and went into the apartment house. I afterwards learned that their apartment was on the second floor. 'The other man remained in the cab and asked me to drive him to the Ambassador Hotel. I did so. He was in the hotel about fifteen minutes. He came out, carrying a leather brief case. 'Shortly after entering the cab he appeared to show the greatest anxiety concerning this brief case. He handed it to me and said, 'I want you to deliver that. For God's sake, don't lose it.' 'His order to me was, 'Drive to 400 Alvarado street. At least, that was the number I caught. There was a 400 in it, but I am not sure whether it was the even number.' Taylor, it will be recalled, lived at 404-B South Alvarado. 'I said to him,' continued Meister, ''Don't you mean 400 ------ street,' naming it. ''Sure,' he said; 'I made a mistake.' 'He asked me several times if the brief case was safe. I said it was. But he was very uneasy. 'Give it to me,' he said, and he took it and put it beside him. 'When we reached the Santa Monica carline--at Santa Monica boulevard and Western avenue, I think it was, he asked me to stop. ''I'm going to take the car here,' he said. 'You will please deliver this,' and he handed me the brief case. ''There'll be a woman looking out the upstairs window waiting for it,' he told me. 'I drove directly to the number on ----- street. Immediately upon my arrival a woman rushed out and asked, 'Have you got it? Did he put it in a box?' 'I said, 'I guess this is what you mean,' and I gave her the brief case. 'Just then a man came running from the side of the house; he was the man I had let out there with the two women. 'He got into the cab. 'Drive me around,' he said--'just keep going around the block! 'I drove him around three or four blocks and then returned to the apartment house. There was a car--a roadster in front. 'When he saw this he became very much excited. 'Don't let them see me,' he said. 'Drive around again.' 'So I drove him around several blocks the second time. The car was still there when we returned, and in even greater excitement he said, 'Don't let them see me. Keep on driving until that car is gone.' 'Upon coming back the third time he asked, 'Is the car still there?' ''Yes,' I said, 'but they are turning on the light. I guess they are getting ready to leave.' 'Just then a street car passed us. 'Keep behind this car,' he said, 'so they won't see me.' 'But the street car went farther on than I had counted on and when we came opposite the roadster, which was then leaving, we were in plain view. 'Upon seeing this my passenger gave an exclamation of alarm, fell to the floor and pulled down the curtain on the side towards the roadster. 'When we stopped at the apartment house he got out and said, 'I was a ----- fool to do this thing'' The police last night were preparing to go to this house and question the occupants. What strikes them with greatest force is that the man who figured in the dramatic attempt at concealment wore a muffler around his neck. It was the man in the muffler whom Mrs. Douglas MacLean saw leaving Taylor's house the night of the murder. If this man had anything to do with the crime, a new theory enters. This is that the murder may have been committed between the time Meister took the four persons to the Wilshire street address and the time the man wearing the muffler rushed out and asked to be driven around the block--in other words while the first man was away on his errand to the Ambassador Hotel. Taylor's house is four blocks west of the home mentioned by the taxi driver. It would be possible to go from Taylor's apartment to this one through alleys, thus eluding detection. If Meister's passenger had anything to do with the crime, then, the police say, he must have called on Taylor soon after Mabel Normand left, probably had a talk with the film director and went away. Then came the episode of the brief case, which is supposed to have contained letters once possessed by Taylor and now missing. There was sufficient time while the first man had gone to the Ambassador for a person to have walked from the Wilshire street address to Taylor's house, committed the crime and returned. The only apparent discrepancy is as to the time the shot was fired. The police yesterday were taking a new view of this subject. Testimony that a shot was heard about 8 o'clock was so uncertain, they said, that no great reliance could be placed in it. On the other hand, a person has been found who heard a shot somewhere near 11 o'clock. The man with the muffler, it was learned yesterday, left for San Francisco the day following the murder. The police were greatly impressed with Meister's story, particularly those parts describing the actors in this mysterious drama as exceedingly nervous. First, the man who went to the hotel was excited and nervous over the brief case. The woman who rushed out to receive it was excited to the point of agitation. The man with the muffler was in a state of frenzy almost about being seen by the person or persons in the roadster. The woman who took the brief case is described as about 30. Meister took her to be a motion picture actress. The man who went to the Ambassador was about 30, of the business man type. The tall man in the muffler was about 35 and Meister supposed he was a motion picture actor. None of the Sheriff's officers seriously entertains the opinion that Edward F. Sands, discharged secretary-valet of Taylor, was the assassin. This is in contradiction to the strongly expressed opinion yesterday of Captain of Detectives David L. Adams. 'I am now completely convinced,' said Captain Adams, 'that Sands is the man we want. I believe it was he who committed the crime. 'We have today established important facts which enable us to reconstruct the crime with what we believe is absolute accuracy. 'Experiments made by our own and outside gun experts demonstrate beyond question that the shot which killed Taylor was fired from a distance of not more than an inch or two from his body. 'We have made many tests with the coat which he wore when the shot struck him down. In the test which produces a hole similar to that already appearing in the coat the muzzle of the revolver was held an inch from the garment. 'When Taylor was shot he had his left arm up. 'We believe that the murderer ordered 'Hands up!' and shot him when he obeyed that command. 'The way I re-frame the picture is this: Sands was lurking around waiting for an opportunity to enter the house, possibly for robbery, and it may have been for some deeper purpose which we have not fathomed. 'The known facts concerning the attitude of this man towards Taylor convince me that we do not know the whole story; we are still far from explaining, for instance, why Sands sent Taylor the pawn ticket and the letter signed 'Alias Jimmy V.' We are also in the dark as to why Sands used Taylor's old name, 'Deane-Tanner,' when he pawned the stolen jewelry. 'Either when or after Taylor accompanied Miss Normand to her car, leaving the front door open, this man slipped into the house. And when the director entered he was there, covering Taylor with his revolver. 'It is possible that Sands went there to secure something--a letter or a document, perhaps--and that he actually did carry away something. 'It is urged against the Sands theory that he would have robbed the dead body, would have stripped off the diamond ring, extracted the money from the pockets and taken the platinum watch. 'I have no doubt he would have done so under ordinary circumstances, as his whole career proves him to be a thief, but this situation was extraordinary. Without having purposed to do so, it may be, he murdered his former master. 'And then, panic-stricken, he hurried from the house, his terror overcoming for the moment his natural instinct to rob.' Although Captain Adams urges his theory with great earnestness, a number of the men working under him do not accept his view of the crime. They cannot conceive that Sands, if he were the man, would have passed over jewelry and money worth nearly $2000 and to be had for the stooping down and taking. However, Captain Adams yesterday issued this instruction: 'Find Edward F. Sands. Whether he is the murderer or not, he must be eliminated.' The identity of the person who extracted the Mabel Normand letters from Taylor's effects remained as much of a mystery yesterday as on the first day of the investigation. It is believed that a man of high position and great influence in the motion picture world found and took these, and others, thinking their discovery would injure the fortunes of actresses in whom he has a business interest. Public Administrator Frank Bryson yesterday admitted that he did not know where they were nor who took them. 'When our representative arrived at the Taylor home Thursday morning,' said Mr. Bryson, 'the room was filled with detectives, motion picture people and reporters, and the premises were swarming with them. 'This office took over all property, effects and documents involved in the estate. Naturally all letters he left belonged to the estate and it was illegal to remove anything. However, I do not understand that anything of money value was taken.' Several letters received yesterday by the police department and the Sheriff's office relating to the record of Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored valet, led Captain Adams to question the negro at greater length regarding his possible knowledge. Peavey is the man who found Taylor's body and gave the alarm. According to Captain Adams, Peavey said nothing new of importance. It is the natural assumption of the detectives and Sheriff's officers that Peavey must have known the persons who called on Taylor. He has stated, however, that only four or five persons called during his six month's service with the director. Among these were Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean and Mabel Normand. In trying to learn what persons were entertained, Sheriff's officers have made a widespread investigation. Yesterday, it is reported, they learned from a source what may or not be authentic--that is something being investigated--that a noted film actress who has been mentioned frequently in stories relating to the case, made several calls at Taylor's apartment at night. It is also asserted by this same person that the actress said she was engaged to marry Taylor; that, in fact, they were to be married within a few weeks. But about New Year's Taylor and the woman had a violent quarrel and the director returned home under stress to such great emotion that he broke down and cried. This actress is one of those who wrote many letters to the picture director, and it is her letters particularly about the disappearance of which the police are so curious. Following yesterday's discovery that the bullet was fired at short range, the theory of suicide was advanced. The absence of a weapon would appear to make this entirely untenable. Also, according to the findings of Dr. A. F. Wagner, county autopsy surgeon, it would have been practically impossible for Taylor to have shot himself in the manner employed. It is only by a wild flight of imagination that one could picture him as a suicide, the police say, because there would have to be discovered in this theory some person who entered the apartment after the tragedy and took the revolver away.

There can be no girl who was jealous of Mr. Taylor's attentions to me. His attitude toward me was only that of a friend who fostered my interest in the better things of life--music, painting and books. 'We never spoke of love, neither of us was interested in the other in that way. If there was a girl with whom he was infatuated it surely was someone else, not I.' Mabel Normand, famous motion picture star, ill from the persistent questioning by those who are seeking to find some one who might have taken the life of William D. Taylor in a spirit of frenzied jealousy, vehemently denied yesterday any love element that existed between her and the slain director. 'Shortly after the inquest Saturday detectives investigating the case came to me and thanked me for my cooperation in aiding in the solving of this terrible tragedy,' she said. 'They told me they are thoroughly convinced it was an unfortunate coincidence that I was seen with him a short time before his murder. 'Everything that I know that might lead to detection of the murderer I have told them. And no one would welcome the apprehension of the culprit that committed that foul deed more than I. 'There have been insinuations made that I went to Mr. Taylor's house after the inquest Saturday to seek some of my letters to him. That is grossly erroneous. I went to the bungalow at the request of the detectives and in their company and solely for the purpose of showing to them the exact location of the furniture as it was placed in the room before I left. It was to show how disordered the place had become after the intrusion of the murderer. 'If Peavey, his colored servant, says that I had asked him about any girls that Mr. Taylor had ever been interested in, it is a venomous fabrication. Never in my life have I spoken to this man directly, and never have I talked to him in any way except in the presence of others, including Mr. Taylor. And as for the subject of girls--the question never entered my mind.' Miss Normand, heavy-lidded from lack of sleep, and worn from the grueling inquisitions to which she has been subjected since the murder, reiterated that no one welcomed the apprehension of the culprit more than she. As for the insinuations that Mr. Taylor had been an attendant at so- called 'dope' parties, she added another vehement denial. 'He loved clean, simple pleasures, not this sordid type,' she said. He was one of the most temperate men in his habits I have ever known. 'He sent me flowers, occasionally, yes. But it was only because he knew I loved them and like to have them about my house. But there never was an expression of love sent with them. He knew our friendship didn't extend to that--it was purely platonic, and like that of an older man interested in a girl who sought mental improvement, and the things that better one in the cultural world.'

Los Angeles, Feb. 6--A pale pink nightgown of filmy silk, trimmed with lace, positively identified as the property of a certain famous motion picture star--whose name has already been mentioned in connection with the murder at his home here last Wednesday night of William Desmond Taylor, photo- play director--is now in the possession of the police and may play a dominant part in a solution of the mystery of Taylor's death. Other developments of the day were an assertion by Taylor's valet that Mabel Normand had told him she was going to marry the picture director, and renewed search for a young New York man now supposed to be at the Mexican border. The nightgown, previously described to the police by servants of the slain director, disappeared from Taylor's apartment on the day after the murder, but was found today after a diligent search by the authorities investigating the tragedy... In this case, it is said, the star to whom the nightgown is believed to belong is not a comedienne. The police do say the article has been identified positively as the property of a 'celebrated motion picture star,' however. A laundry mark of three letters gave police their clues to the ownership of the dainty garment. It had been kept in a box in a drawer of Taylor's dresser, Henry Peavey, negro valet of the murdered director, admitted. Peavey told the police, under pressure, that the gown had mysteriously disappeared the day after the murder. It was not until late today that it turned up, in the hands of a police detective who had been working independently on the case. This detective obtained what he declared to be positive identification of the nightgown. The injection of the woman film star into the mystery gives rise to more speculation about the identity of the assassin, as it enlarges the field of suspects to include all of the many men admirers of the girl, for at the present time the police view every intimate friend of the women who were known to be close associates of Taylor as a potential enemy and possible murderer through the jealousy which Taylor's attachment may have aroused...

New York, Feb. 6--Lila Wylie, the beautiful actress who entered the limelight in New York last spring in connection with the 'international blackmail ring' expose following the shooting of John Reid, wealthy manufacturer, is sought for questioning in the Taylor murder case in Los Angeles, it was learned today. Miss Wylie's possible connection with the mystery is said to be linked with that of 'Dapper Don' Collins, also sought by the Los Angeles police. The authorities expect her to shed considerable light on her own activities as they concerned William Desmond Taylor during the weeks just preceding the murder. Miss Wylie disappeared from Los Angeles on the day the Taylor murder was discovered. She is not suspected of the crime, but the police expect her knowledge of Taylor to aid them. The police say they have traced her movements to Miami, Fla., where she is supposed to be registered at a fashionable resort hotel...

E Los Angeles, Feb. 6--...Capt. Adams' conference in his office late today with Charles Eyton, referred to the scenes at the bungalow. And eventually they got back to Mabel's letters. 'I had heard about those letters,' the captain said. 'I looked for them when I went to the house Thursday noon, some time after Taylor's body had been found. They were gone.' 'It is possible some of Taylor's friends who got there first took the letters,' Eyton said. 'I would have taken them if I had been there in time.' There were perhaps a dozen film stars at the house before the police arrived. One of the first to get there was Arthur Hoyt, a friend of long standing.

That William D. Taylor, murdered movie director, was held at the point of a pistol before he was murdered was the theory expressed by detectives Tuesday. In support of this theory, the police bring out these points: Taylor's shirt was pulled somewhat out of his belt. Holding his hands in the air while menaced with a revolver would account for that. The slayer evidently held the gun within three or four inches of Taylor's body, as powder marks on the clothing indicate. As Taylor fell, the assassin might have caught him and laid him on his back. The fact that there were no bruises on Taylor's head or body, which would have been caused had he fallen, accounts for this conjecture. Having his hands in the air would explain why the bullet missed Taylor's arm. The assassin evidently shot from the hip, the way of a two-gun bad man, the detectives point out, thus sending the bullet on its diagonal course through the ribs, heart and into the neck.

...Guards surrounded the home of Mary Miles Minter, prominent film star and close friend of Taylor, Tuesday. Captain David L. Adams and the squad of eight police detectives who are working on the mystery, scattered to various parts of the city following a conference. They were working on a number of clues, any one of which may develop into something tangent. Before the detectives left police headquarters they subjected Henry Peavey, Taylor's Negro valet, to another questioning, but the valet was unable to tell them anything new. The four private detectives, who guarded the home of Mary Miles Minter on North Hobart boulevard, shooed all visitors away. They are supposed to have been hired by Miss Minter... A cigarette stub carelessly dropped in front of a garage at Temple and Hill streets may lead to the discovery of the murderer of Taylor. If the police could have laid hands on the man who dropped the bit of paper wrapped around a few shreds of tobacco the mystery that has baffled the entire country would be solved today. But the man slipped through their hands with a margin of only a few minutes between him and capture. The smoker, an indistinct figure, lounged in the doorway of the garage in the darkness of night. A man drove in with his automobile and the smoker stepped aside, casting away the cigarette. The driver, engaged in negotiating the doorway, did not once glance... But a few minutes later a policeman picked up the cigarette stub and examined it. It was gold-tipped and bore the special design seen only on the cigarettes made to order for Taylor. Nino Andrinie, editor of 'La Patria,' an Italian newspaper, was the motorist who drove into the garage while the man was lounging in the doorway. The policeman who found the cigarette stub awakened the editor at his apartments in the Alhambra a few hours later and questioned him. Andrinie could not give a good description of the man he saw. The police theory that Edward F. Sands, former secretary of the movie director may know who committed the murder, was strengthened greatly by the cigarette clue... 'If we can find Sands,' declared Captain David L. Adams, in charge of the police investigation, 'this mystery will be solved. Unless he can account for his whereabouts Wednesday night he will be under the strongest possible suspicion.' Telegraphic orders for the arrest of a man believed to be Sands were sent to Carlin, Nev., where a man answering his description is under surveillance. The arrest was expected today... The startling theory that Sands is in reality Taylor's missing brother, Dennis, was scouted as impossible today by Mrs. Ada Deane-Tanner, divorced wife of the missing man. Mrs. Deane-Tanner, when shown a photograph of Sands at her Monrovia home, pointed out points of dissimilarity which led to this theory, developed by detectives working on the baffling murder mystery, to be discarded. Sands is short and stocky, with plump, round face. Dennis Deane-Tanner was slender like his brother, and his clear-cut features much resembled those of the murdered director. Besides, Mrs. Deane-Tanner explained, her husband's nose had been broken in athletics, which gave him a noticeable mark. Neither could there be any possibility, according to her, that Taylor was her missing husband, playing a dual role. She and other friends who knew both brothers in New York, saw and talked to Taylor in Los Angeles and could not be deceived about his identity... So far two reported 'sons' of Taylor have been heard from and are being traced. One of the young men, about 25 years of age, introduced himself as a son of the eminent director when he took some manuscript to F. H. McDowell, associate editor of 'Screenland,' about two weeks ago. The police today were looking for the young man at the address which he left with McDowell. The other youth who claimed to be Taylor's son, was interviewed by a man who knew the movie director when the boy registered for war service at Columbia University, New York. The young man was reported as being very bitter towards Taylor, cursing at mention of his name. He did not say why he hated the man whom he represented as his father.

PRESS FILM STAR FOR TAYLOR CLEW Police Conduct'Long and Grueling' Examination, working on Jealousy Motive. MABEL. MORMAMD SPEAKS Tellis Reporters Affections for Slain Director was Based on Comradeship, Not 'Love.' LOs ANGELES, Feb. 6.A motion picture actress was subjected to what the police termed a "long and grueling" examination at her home here tonight in an attempt to obtain a clew to the murderer of William Desmond Taylor. The actress was said to be widely known, but her name was withheld by the police, Two detective sergeants examined her. What they learned they kept to themselves. They admitted they were seeking to develop the previously advanced theory that Taylor had been slain by a jealous rival for the affections of the actress. Mabel Normand, who was among the last persons to see Taylor alive, made a number of declarations "on her word of honor" to newspaper interviewers today. Not in "Love" with Taylor. "Were you ever in love with Taylor?" they asked her. "Not in the way one means when he uses the expression "in love," On my word of honor, no," she said. "Get it straight. Our friendship was based on comradeship and understanding." "Did you know any woman who might have been jealous of you-who might have loved Taylor?" "On my word of honor, no." "Or any man who might have been jealous of the place he occupied in your esteem?" "On my word of honor, no." "It has been hinted he gave drug parties. Did you ever hear of them" "Never in God's world, never, on my word of honor." After some questions, she said: "And, oh please, say that I never heard of that pink silk night robe they say is missing from Mr. Taylor's apartments." "But Henry Peavey, the negro houseman, said " " He ought to be ashamed of himself for saying I asked him about other girls. going to Mr. Taylors house," she exclaimed. I saved him his job once when Mr. Taylor wanted to fire him," If Sands, the missing butler, can be found the complaint against him chargeing grand larceny, made by Taylor and now in the hands of the police, will be dropped, it was announced tonight by Captain Adams, who stated that as Taylor was dead the case could not be taken to court. Therefore, he added, if Sands could clear himself of all connection with Taylor's death no other charge would be placed against him. Adams said he had information which led him to believe that regardless of where Sands might have been last Wednesday night he was not in Los Angeles at present. He said none of the persons who had stated Sands was in the city just before the murder had said they had talked with him. Several women with whom Sands was said to have been friendly have been interviewed by the police, and all are reported to have stated that they had neither seen nor heard from him for months. Investigate Chautfeur's Clue. An unidentified "party of men" was driven to the neighborhood of the Taylor apartment the night be was murdered, according to a story told the police today by a taxicab driver. What else the chauffeur told the police they did not make public, but it was known that in the search for the slayer of the motion picture director, the detectives examined six men today. These included Charles Eyton, general manager of the Famous Players-Lasky Company, by which Taylor had been employed, and Henry Peavey, negro house servant of the head dirctor. The examination of the four unnamed men including the chauffeur, was in furtherance of the search for Edward F. Sands, or Edward Fitz Strathmore, the missing butler. The chauffeur's suspicions were said to have been aroused after reading of the murder, and he communicated his knowledge to the police, He and a companion were in secret conference with the police several hours and during that period took a hurried automobile ride with the detectives. Two of the four men were said to have entered into the investigation for the first time today. Twice during the day all the detectives working on the case were called together in conference with Captain Adams, They said they were concentrating their efforts in an attempt to locate Sands. Mr. Eyton had a long talk with Captain Adams, and Peavey was examined again. Late in the day the detectives asserted letters known to have been in Taylor's possession just before his death, in addition to those said to have been written by Mabel Normand and sought by her in vain at his apartment after his body was found, were missing. No one examined by the police so far has admitted any knowledge of the whereabouts of the missing letters. Eyton said he had not seen them. Miss Normand stated she had not. The Public Administrator, who has charge of the Taylor estate, said he had not seen them, and the District Attorney made a like statement. Eyton's visit to the Central Police Station, it was said, was in relation to the efforts to find Sands. Eyton aided the police in obtaining photographs of Sands, but no really good portraits of him are available, it is said. It was determined today that the bullet that killed Taylor was fired from a distance of a very few inches. This was taken as evidence that the assassin did not conceal himself in some part of the room and fire from a distance of ten or more feet, and it was also taken to indicate that the overturned chair might have been upset in a brief struggle between Taylor and his slayer. The facts in relation to Taylor's change of name from that of William Cunningham Deane-Tanner are also being studied. It is generally believed, however, that this was due to Taylor's desire to be free from his former family relations, and to the ordinary custom of screen and stage stars and workers whereby they assume any name that happens to appeal to them. Early today police and attachés of the Sheriff's office again examined the dead man's papers in the hope of obtaining a better clue than any yet evolved." George Milo, the motion picture actor, who was taken from his work last night and examined as to his whereabouts at the time of the shooting, was freed of all connection with the case, as the result of his statement and the investigation that later verified his story. "Mr. Taylor loved Mabel Normand, but I do not believe that she returned his love to any great extent," Harry Peavey, houseman for Taylor, is reported to have told representatives of The Los Angeles Times. "I was in Mr. Taylor's home for almost six months, and I know that Mr. Taylor was very much in love with Miss Normand. At times I thought that she returned his love and then again it seemed to me that she was tired of him. "One night, almost a month before Mr. Taylor was killed, Miss Normand came to the house for dinner. After dinner I passed through the front room while they were talking, and she stopped me and told me that she and Mr. Taylor were to be married. He was sitting there and did not say a word. She wanted to know if I would work for them. She never came often. While I worked there she was there only about a dozen times. She was there the night before the murder and the night of the murder. I know she was there Tuesday night, the night before the murder, because she told me so. Mr. Taylor wrote a letter to Miss Normand almost every day of the week. His driver would take notes to Miss Normand's home by automobile after breakfast in the mornings. He sent flowers to her three days a week. "Once Miss Normand asked me what other girls had dined with Mr. Taylor. I told her there was only one. She asked me the name, and I told her: "Miss Normand." She laughed and said that Mr. Taylor had me well trained. Miss Normand was with Mr. Taylor the last time I saw him alive. My master asked me to mix up some cocktails, and I did. I placed the liquor in the shaker on a tray with two glasses, and Mr. Taylor and Miss Normand were drinking when I left for the evening. They both said goodnight to me and I left the house. When I next saw Mr. Taylor, the next morning, he was dead on the floor of his living room. Search for New Yorker. The jealousy theory, the police and private detectives reported, was causing a search to be made for a prominent young New York man, formerly engaged to a film star. This man was reported today to have checked out of a hotel here on the day of the murder and to have left the City the following afternoon. He is believed to have headed for San Diego and possibly to have crossed the border into Mexico. His name is withheld. The actress to whom he was at one time engaged, according to investigators, was a close friend of the slain director, and in this friendship, they say, they see a possible motive for jealousy which might lead to murder. The police today were looking for the pink silk nightgown missing from Taylor's home. Sands Reported in Nevada. A man said to answer the description of Sands, the missing butler, is in Carlin, Nev,, tonight, according to messages received by the Los Angeles police tonight. Not. Listed at Fusilier Officer. Copyright, 1922, by The Chicago Tribune Co. LONDON, Feb. 6. William Desmond Taylor was never an officer attached to the Fifth Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, according to the official records of the Fusiliers, who are now stationed at Hounslow Barracks, London, where the Adjutant searched through 46,000 names of officers and men of the regiment who were in the World War at the request of The Chicago Tribune today. The official record lists, however, "W. D. Taylor. address 1,127 Orange Street, Los Angeles, aged 41: profession, director: Born Cork, Ireland: height. 5 feet 11 inches: British subject: enlistment attested at Chicago, July 3. 1918, by the British Recruiting Mission in America. The next official trace of Taylor is when he arrived at Hounslow Barracks, Dec. 2, 1918, after the armisfice, as a private in the ranks of the Royal Fusiliers, coming in a draft of 500 Britishers who had enlisted in America. A veteran enlisted man of the regiment remembers that Taylor said he was Mary Pickford's director. Taylor was at Hounslow three days, and is said to have been Acting Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant. On Dec. 5, 1918, he he was transferred to the army service corps at the Expeditionary Force canteen on Victoria Street, London. Praises Taylor as Soldier. William Desmond Taylor, the moving picture director murdered in Hollywood. won the affection and respect of every one who came in contact with him while he was in the British Army, and Stuart E. Cooling of 2,374 Third Avenue, Provost Sergeant of the camp where Taylor entered the service, swore that no matter what any one said about Bill Taylor he would never believe scandal in connection with him. Cooling was on duty in Ireland in 1887 with the Fourth Hussars and is sure that Dr. Deane-Tanner, a friend and associate of Parnell and an infiuential man in the old Nationalist Party. was an uncle of Taylor or William Cunningharm Deane-Tanner his right name, Taylor, he said, "came to Camp Fort Edward at Windsor, Nova Scotia, in the Summer of 1919 with other recruits. I was Provost Sergeant. He was very quick to learn and became a Lance Corporal in two weeks, a Corporal in three weeks, a Sergeant in five weeks. and a company Sergeant Major in two months. Then we went to England and he got a Lieutenant's commission in the Army Service corps of the British Army. His men worshipped himwould do anything for him. We N. C. O.'s, his pals, always found him a man who never thought of himself, who was always helping the underdog, those who had less than he had. I wouidn't believe wrong of him, no matter what anybody said."

GRILL FILM ACTRESS Unnamed Woman Cross-questioned in Taylor 's Death. MEN NEAR MURDER SCENE Chauffeur Tells of Driving "Party;" Six Under Examination. Missing New Yorker Now Sought. Actor Arrested Sunday Is Freed. Must Find Sands, Slain Man's Butler, Say Officers, Who Are Working on Elimination Theory. More Letters Declared Missing. (By the Associated Press.) Los Angeles, Calif., Feb. 6. -A motion picture actress was subjected to what the police termed a "long and gruelling" questioning at her home here tonight in an attempt to obtain a clew to the murder of William Desmond Taylor, director. The actress was said to be widely known, but her name was withheld by the police. Two detective sergeants questioned her. What they learned they kept to themselves, but they admitted they were seeking to develop the previously advanced theory that Taylor had been slain by a jealous rival for the affections of the actress. New Theory of Murder. A new theory as to the exact manner in which William Desmond Taylor was slain last Wednesday night, was advanced tonight. Detectives said they were convinced the director was standing with his hands above his head when a 88 calibre pistol was pressed against his side, about six inches below the left arm-pit and toward the back. They based this theory on a careful examination today of the clothing worn by the director at the time he was shot. The holes in the coat and in the vest do not correspond as to location when the coat is adjusted normally. When the sleeves were raised the hole in the coat was brought up to the hole in the vest. Drove Party of Men. An unidentified "party of men" was a driven to the vicinity of the apartments of Taylor the night he was murdered, according to the story told the police by a taxicab deriver. What else the chauffeur told the police the latter did not make public but it was known that in the search, for the slayer of the motion picture director, detectives questioned six men today. These include Charles Eyton, genneral manager of the Famous PlayersLasky company, by which Taylor had been employed, and Henry Peavey, negro house servant of the dead director. The questioning of the four unnamed men, which included the chauffeur, was in furtherance of the search for Edward F. Sands, or Edward Fitz Strathmore, the missing former butler for Taylor. Chauffeur Informs Police. The chauffeur 's suspicions were said to have been aroused after reading of the murder and he communicated his knowledge to the police. He and a companion were in secret conference with the police several hours, and during that period took a hurried automobile ride with the detectives. Two of the four men were said to have entered into the investigation for the first time today. Twice during the day all the detectives working on the case were called together in conference with Captain of Detectives David Adams. They declared they were concentrating their efforts in an attempt to locate Sands. Mr. Eyton had a long talk with Capt. Adams and Peavey also was questioned again. Late in the day officers declared letters known to have been in Taylor 's possession shortly before his death, in addition, to those said to have been written by Mabel Normand, film actress, and sought by her in vain at his apartment after his body was found, were missing. Not seen By Eyton. No one questioned by the police so far, has admitted any knowledge of their whereabouts. Eyton said he had not seen them. Miss Normand stated she had not. The public administrator, who has charge of the Taylor estate, said he had not seen the letters and the district attorney made a like statement. Eyton's visit to the central police station, it was said, is in connections with the efforts of the, officers to find Sands, who is said to have been near the Taylor apartment as little as two hours before the shooting. Eyton aided the officers in obtaining photographs of Sands, but no really good picture of him is avail able, it is said. The investigation has simmered down to the process of elimination, according to Capt. Adams, hundreds of "tips" having come to the is police from various sources, solicited and unsolicited. Miss Normand, through a representative, announced today she planned to have her telephone number changed to avoid "the continual stream of calls" reaching her recently. Must Capture Sands. "Edward F. Sands must be captured in order that his elimination may be made complete or a charge entered against him," said Capt. David L Adams, in charge of the police investigation. CONTINUED ON FIFTH PAGE. GRILL FLM ACTRESS CONTINUED FROM FIRST PAGE. It was determined by police investigation today that the bullet that killed Taylor was fired point blank; that is, from a distance of a very few inches. This was taken as evidence that his assailant did not conceal himself in some other part of the room and fire from a distance of 10 or more feet: and it was also taken to indicate that the overturned chair might have been upset in a brief struggle between Taylor and his slayer. These salient points had emerged from a mass of contradictory stories and statements, some of which were based on theories, as yet unproven, that Taylor was engaged in clandestine affairs with various women. Many persons questioned. So far, numerous people prominent in the motien picture world have had at least a slight connection with the affair. In this number may be listed Mabel Normand, who was the last person to visit Mr. Taylor before the shooting occured. He escorted her to her automobile and returned to the room where he met his death, according to the facts so far established. Another widely known movie star, whose name was brought into the case was Mary Miles Minter, who had been a business and social acquaintance of the dead man and who was one of the first to be advised of his death. Then Charles Eyton, production manager at the Lasky studios, where Mr. Taylor was employed, was frequently named because he was one of the first to arrive at the scene after Henry Peavey, colored houseman, found the body: and because he was quite active in early investigation. Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean, also known in the screen world, told of having seen a an leave the Taylor house at the hour of the shooting: and various others, some approaching the magnitude of stars, and others from the owly extra ranks, have touched various angles of the affair. Sands Name Always Up. In all these investigations, repeated reccurence of the name of Sands finally led to the declaration of Captain Adams that Sands' discovery was esential to further progress. Sands has not been seen here since the shooting, nor is there any definite proof that he was seen here immeditely preceding it. Officers said he might be concealing himself because he feared to face a grand larceny charge preferred against him by Taylor and still pending. This charge, they said, was no longer serious because without the testimony of Taylor conviction would be difficult, but they admitted that Sands might not realize this condition. Seek Missing New Yorker. Jealousy, police and private detertives reported today, has directed search for a prominent young New York man, formerly engaged to ones of the beautiful stars of filmdom. This suspect was reported today to have checked out of a hotel here on the day of the murder and left the city the following afternoon.
