Magazines devoted to motion picture plays and players do a great deal of harm by the nauseating drivel that they print. The silly prattle that is put into the mouths of screen players who are 'interviewed' for these magazines and then pen pictures drawn of them are beyond reason. Rex Ingram, a scholar, is not given any better 'boost' than a former salesgirl who has suddenly become a headliner. The same superlatives that are used to discuss Ingram are used to describe the brainless cutie whose face is her fortune and whose brain is still in the kindergarten age. It is a long jump from paperbound novels and chewing gum to Plato and Thoreau, but the facile writer of the screen monthlies blithely makes this leap. It must have been with pain and anguish that the screen fans read how Mabel Normand, pictured as a devotee of Voltaire and Nietzsche, testified that on her way to William Taylor's house on the fatal night she stopped at a newstand to buy a bag of peanuts and a copy of the POLICE GAZETTE.

No more perfect stage setting for a dramatic tragedy could have been wished for by the most exacting director or stage manager than the artistic arrangement of the house in which William D. Taylor, director and art connoisseur, met his death. If the front wall of the house had been removed, a description of the first floor might well be taken for the preface of a one-act play. Imagining this front wall to be a drop curtain which has just been rolled up there will appear in the extreme foreground, a little right of center, a small mahogany writing desk, over which are scattered papers, checks and letters. At the left of center stands a magnificent grand piano [sic] with an oriental covering of soft mauves and mulberry shades. At right of center a large tapestry divan of neutral tone, figured in dull mauve tints. Behind the divan a large window curtained in deep cream filet lace with aide drapes of figured chintz harmonizing in color with the mulberry velvet carpet on the floor. Immediately behind this large living room, separated from it merely by simulated pillars, is a small dining room. The carpet is of the identical color, fabric and pattern as that which covers the living room floor; a William and Mary dining room table stands in the center and scattered through both rooms are reed and mahogany chairs, upholstered in mulberry velvet. The walls of these adjoining rooms are covered with dull gold and olive tapestry over which are hung scores of photographs, pictures of beautiful moving picture actresses and of men known internationally in the film world. Perhaps no single wall in the world held so complete a collection of famous screen beauties. Behind the dining room is a small kitchen, complete in every detail from its white enamel sink and drain boards to its spotless refrigerator and polished range. The front bedroom, furnished in old ivory, with a pale blue Axminster rug and white muslin curtains, was the one formerly occupied by the man who met his death at the hands of an assassin's bullet. Two large windows looked out on the wide, green court and side windows, allowing floods of light and air, gave the room an unusually well ventilated aspect. On the dresser lay numerous toilet articles, all silver mounted and handsome, showing the aesthetic taste of a fastidious man, but all plain and substantial without any effeminate touches. On the table lay a variety of books, fiction, history, technical volumes connected with the work of the dead man. A blue and white blanket and a white Marseilles spread covered the bed in which the dead man was wont to sleep. This had been his home for the last three years and standing there on the threshold of this room, the most private sanctum and retreat a human being maintains for himself, one wondered what dreams of romance, wealth or glory flitted through the brain of the man now sleeping beneath six feet of earth [sic] and a blanket of roses, or what haunting fears, arising from spectres of the past, tormented that crumpled pillow? Of all the beautiful women that he knew, which face was it that floated through his dreams, and was it to hope and anticipated pleasure or to despair that he awoke in the morning? In the bedroom at the rear stand twin beds, covered with plain white spreads. Between the two bedrooms is a white tiled bath room with a huge tub and shower and a large medicine cabinet filled with bottles of every description, household remedies and simple drugs, but showing that the former occupant suffered with a variety of ailments from eye trouble to falling hair. In this cabinet were two varieties of talcum powder, two perfume bottles with distinctly different odors, and other articles pertaining more to feminine tastes than masculine. An air of seclusion and security one might have felt in this house, which is set well back in the court from the street and surrounded by sedate looking dwellings that would seem to frown on and forbid the presence of crime. But from the successful manner in which the murderer has broken all threads of the clew which would implicate him in the deed, probably no more cold-blooded crime was ever planned. There at the little mahogany desk, in the immediate foreground, a trifle to the right of center, on Wednesday evening, February 1, about eight o'clock, sat William D. Taylor, probably the best known and best loved moving picture director in the West. A bright light burned over his desk and a long evening's work lay ahead of him. With the lights out in the kitchen and the dining room at the rear, a murderer might well have hidden in the dusky, purple shadows, and over the soft velvet carpet he could have glided in silence until he reached out and touched his victim. Who knows but what he may have muffled his revolver and shot at such close range that the speeding bullet made no perceptible report or echo, except in the startled consciousness of the man whose soul and body were rent apart in the twinkling of an eye. And all night long, as the body of the murdered man lay on the floor, the crimson life-blood silently oozing out drop by drop, dyeing the soft carpet a deeper hue, all night long the lights burned on his desk, throwing weird gleams and shadows on the pictures of the beautiful moving picture actresses on the wall; what ghosts stalked through this silent sepulcher that night? What echoes of the fleeing murderer resounded in the streets outside? But now, as though no breath of crime had ever stifled out a human life, the birds twitter in the eaves and over the doorway and the sun streams through the windows and flickers in dancing circles over the carpets, which show no visible reminders of the crime. Only a silence, a hush like that of wonder, seems to hold the unspoken whisper. Why? Who? Where is he now?

...Mr. Doran is said to be interested in the report that Taylor's body had been carefully laid out. This statement comes from F. Parsons, a member of the police flying squadron, who, with Detective Zeigler, was the first to reach the scene of the crime. The director, says Parsons, was not sprawled on the floor, as one would have expected, considering the apparent physical facts of the slaying, but was lying with feet together and hands at sides as though some person had very carefully arranged his body. Would a man like Sands have taken this trouble? Would a man whose jealousy had turned into hate and hate flared forth in an act of murder have been concerned how the victim appeared in death? Rather, ask the police, does not the patient care with which this funereal task was performed suggest the slayer to have been a woman who loved him?... Captain Adams and men working under him on the case attach great importance to the bullet removed from the body of Taylor and to its peculiar value as evidence should the murderer ever be caught and brought to trial. Firearms experts have determined that it is of a kind manufactured many years ago and have found rifling marks and a nick on one of its edges. As a result of its classification the police now have a fairly accurate idea of the character of revolver used. It was learned yesterday that operatives of the United States Department of Justice have conducted an independent investigation and have developed certain angles not appearing in the evidence secured by the police or sheriff's officers. One of these, it is said, relates to a woman who has not been mentioned in any of the reports thus far published. Valuable information, it is said, was secured from this woman.

...Mabel Normand, slated as one of the chief witnesses today, already has made a statement for use by the district attorney's office. This statement, relative to her letters which mysteriously disappeared for seven days, corroborates her previous assertions regarding them. Her testimony in this regard reads in part: 'I went to Mr. Taylor's home on Wednesday evening (just previous to the slaying of the director) to get back the letters I had written to him. He said, 'I mailed them back to you yesterday.' I replied that they had not yet arrived and then he said, 'I think Eyton or Garbutt have them.' Then I told him that I did not care if the world saw them except that it might be embarrassing to both of us because they might be misunderstood.' Miss Normand also added that her physical condition was such at the time of her asserted conversation with Taylor that she could not remember much of his actual conversation with her. She was on the verge of a nervous breakdown at that time, she said... [The above material is considered to be totally incorrect and fabricated by the press.]

...it was said that a prominent film man, acting in executive capacity at one of the larger studios, would be called to tell what he knows of the strange disappearance of the Normand letters. The missives, according to the star herself, were in Taylor's possession at the time of his death. They had dropped from sight when the murder was discovered. Then, just seven days later, they came to light hidden in one of Taylor's riding boots. It is possible, investigators conclude, that the packet was taken by the man mentioned, 'edited,' and some of the letters removed. The alleged 'merely friendly' ones were then returned according to this theory. Miss Normand had previously stated that there was nothing serious between Taylor and herself, but that some of the letters contained endearing terms... ...At the sheriff's office practically every investigator scoffs at the Sands theory. The attempted fixing of responsibility on the former secretary, is a 'frame-up,' it is charged, and the outgrowth of the 'conspiracy of silence' which, it is asserted, has been planned by certain important personages in the motion picture industry.

Hollywood Up In Arms At Frank Mayo An avalanche of indignation followed today in the wake of the statement credited to Frank Mayo, film actor, in a New York dispatch yesterday, in which the Hollywood motion picture colony was severely criticized. Publication of Mayo's interview brought instant protest. The actor's ears must have 'burned' continually since yesterday if the superstition holds good, for all Hollywood 'panned' him unmercifully. For the moment he was as big a subject for conversation as was the Taylor murder. Mayo's unexpected attack on the Hollywood motion picture colony was described as 'ravings' and 'an example of the lengths to which some notoriety- seeking individuals will go to get their name in the paper.' Scores of picture celebrities and studio executives strongly condemn Mayo's act. At every studio protests were heard. Mayo recently figured in a sensational divorce suit. As one prominent star put it, 'Persons who live in glass houses should not throw stones.'

Psychics Seek Solution of Murder While police, sheriff's deputies and district attorney's detectives are following every earthly clue in the endeavor to track down the mysterious person who murdered William D. Taylor in his Alvarado street apartment, the psychical research societies and the spiritualistic devotees of Los Angeles are seeking through the invisible lanes of the supernatural to establish communication with the slain man on the 'other side.' Friends of Mr. Taylor say that he was a devout believer in the ability of spirits of the departed to manifest themselves to those still occupying their earthly bodies. 'When I go into the great adventure,' he is quoted as having said, 'I will use every effort that is possible on the 'other side' to get back into communication with those remaining on earth,' and it is with the belief that Taylor's spirit will retain the power to carry out this promise that the psychics and spiritualists of Los Angeles are centralizing their efforts upon the attempt to get into communication with him. These devotees of the occult firmly believe that it is possible for this to be done and they hold it would prove a tremendous proof of the truth of their beliefs if through spirit means a solution of the baffling death mystery could be worked out. Thus far, however, they freely admit that nothing definite has been obtained from their concerted efforts. This difficulty is being explained away by the psychics by the statement that in cases of sudden death, such as that of Mr. Taylor, the resultant mental shock and confusion of the instant is liable to last some little time after the death of the body and the spirit is very apt to linger around the old home, trying to adjust itself to the more familiar physical surroundings. According to their beliefs there is a very definite reason why word is not easily obtained from the unseen when related to the commission of a crime, and that is that as such information is invariably subject to the laws of destiny, not fate. According to this law, they say, the whole tape of experience must unravel itself in its own sequence, just as the flower exposes its true nature in its complete unfolding. The fundamental laws upon which these psychics say that they will base their efforts for communication are exactly the same as those which govern the underlying principle of wireless telegraphy. Some of the most noted psychics of the city have expressed the keenest interest in the effort and will try to secure what they term 'dependable communications' from the deceased motion picture director through one of their centers and from some one of the spiritual planes. Authorities claim that the conditions for the success of such a communication are more favorable now than ever before, since a certain cycle which has passed seems to have materially thinned the intervening veil. Many will await with interest the outcome of this widely organized effort.

I am still clinging to my original theory of the crime--that the man with the cap whom my maid saw loitering in the alleyway the night of the murder slipped into Mr. Taylor's apartments when he escorted Mabel Normand to her motor and shot him immediately after he had returned to his suite and closed the door behind him.' Such was the assertion today of pretty little Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of the famous screen star, and whose apartment in the court at 400 South Alvarado street diagonally faces that of the slain cinema director, William Desmond Taylor. According to Mrs. MacLean, in the three years Taylor had occupied the apartment at 404-B South Alvarado, he had only entertained a few times, living on the whole a quiet and secluded existence and visited only by his intimate circle of friends. 'It seemed strange to see them moving Mr. Taylor's belongings today,' said Mrs. MacLean. 'He was certainly an ideal neighbor in every respect. Mr. MacLean and myself used to frequently see men visitors go to his apartments and now and again we would hear the familiar voice of some celebrated star chatting outside on his steps. 'But he never gave any wild parties--indeed, he never gave any other kind, either, but seemed to enjoy best simple amusements. 'It seems perfect plausible to me that the murderer could have slipped into Mr. Taylor's apartments during those few minutes when we all know he was escorting Miss Normand to her waiting motor car. Mr. MacLean and myself discovered that it would have been possible for the man whom my maid reported as loitering in the alleyway to have kept watch on Mr. Taylor's front doorway from where he was standing. 'My maid declared that the man was unusually still and silent for a loiterer. I suppose that I undoubtedly saw the murderer as he left Mr. Taylor's apartments that night. But it was dark and I couldn't see his face at all. 'According to my theory the man who killed Mr. Taylor was crouched back of the door, by the wall, and so was not discovered until after the door had been closed by Mr. Taylor. Then I believe that the man shot almost immediately. 'Mr. MacLean and myself are certain that we heard the shot and Mr. Jessurun, the manager, who has the adjoining apartment, also heard the report. But you know how little attention one pays to such noises-- especially when they are not repeated. We supposed it was a motor car and let it go at that. 'But I think that every one in any way affiliated with the motion picture industry is determined never to give up the trail until the slayer is apprehended.'

...Rumors that the district attorney's office has undertaken an investigation of reports that thousands of dollars had been spent by motion picture interests to quiet the investigation of Taylor's death were vigorously denied today. Doran stated that police detectives and others have been in close touch with the district attorney's office and that no attempts to block the investigation had been encountered by him as yet. The fact that the district attorney's office has taken charge of the investigation is said to please motion picture officials vitally interested in the case. With Woolwine and Doran in charge the investigation will proceed systematically without unwarranted suspicion being directed against innocent parties. It was considered probable today that Woolwine will withdraw from the trial of Mrs. Madalynne Obenchain, charged with the murder of J. Belton Kennedy, to take direct and personal charge of the investigation of the Taylor case. Woolwine intended entering the trial of Mrs. Obenchain after the selection of the jury had been completed...

...Bryson said that an investigation of Taylor's checks running back through several years had just been completed by a federal government employee connected with the income tax department and that there were no missing checks. The complete tally of checks with the stubs indicates that no effort was made by Taylor's murderer to suppress evidence of blackmailing activities, according to Public Administrator Bryson Bryson also said that the check probe showed that Taylor had not spent a dollar for insurance. Efforts to interview Mack Sennett, moving picture producer and employer of Mabel Normand, to ascertain his theory on whether Mabel Normand's visit had anything to do with precipitating the crime, failed Thursday. 'Mr. Sennett has been confined to his bed for the past two weeks with a severe cold,' his Japanese servant told a Record reporter late Thursday at the Sennett residence, 141 Menlo street. The Japanese servant took the reporter's card inside the house. A moment later another servant returned with profuse apologies, saying that Sennett had such a sore throat that he could not talk. He said his employer had been ill and confined to his bed for two weeks. Major Thomas A. Osborne, British consul, with offices in the Loew State Theater building, was momentarily expecting a telegram from Judge Frank G. Schrenkheisen, New Rochelle, New York, personal representative of Ethel Daisy Tanner, daughter of the murdered man, it was said Thursday. British consulates in the United States are working independently to solve the murder mystery, Attorney B. Rey Schauer, counsel for the local consulate, said. Five persons had been examined late Thursday by District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine, who took over the direction of the investigation just before noon... Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz announced Thursday that further questioning of Mrs. Douglas MacLean Wednesday night resulted in clearing her of the implication that she was holding something back in order to protect the motion picture industry from scandal. He said that Mrs. MacLean convinced him she was telling all she knew about seeing a man on the Taylor porch just after the murder. There are others in the movie colony who are not so frank, Biscailuz hinted... A literary lover, who, with books, suggested things a less adroit man would bluntly speak. This analysis of the character of Taylor forms a basis for the murder theory upon which one group of investigators are now working...The county detectives who are following this new trail hold that Taylor was not entirely indifferent to women. He was, however, what might be called choicy--a connoisseur. According to their theory, when the fancy of the eminent picture director became fixed on a certain woman he made her the present of a book. It was a book on some subject--not too intimate--that would easily give rise to comment and discussion between the donor and the recipient. This book was followed by another, more intimate in character, which suggested some subjects not hitherto discussed between them. This book suggested another, and so on. By this time he would have thoroughly established himself with the woman... W. C. Doran, chief aide to District Attorney Woolwine, who is now in command of the united forces of investigators, announced Thursday that private interests would be disregarded in the effort to capture Taylor's slayer. The film folk who might have any knowledge bearing upon the past of Taylor will be rigidly questioned, according to Doran's statement. Among the movie characters who are expected to go on the grill there are two outstanding figures, both men, both producers of world-wide reputation, both supposed to be admirers of a celebrated film actress who was a close friend of the murdered man. Both men will be asked to account for their whereabouts on the night of the murder. One is supposed to have been confined to his home by illness. The whereabouts of the other has not been suggested.

It was a lonely little Mary Miles Minter who described William D. Taylor, the murdered motion picture director. With one satin-slippered foot doubled under her, and her white hands linked about her other knee as she sat on the huge divan in her home the little blonde star said: 'He was so dignified--so austere--so wonderful! 'Everyone loved dear Old Billy Taylor. 'He was always good to everyone. 'I was always happy when I was out with him--which, unfortunately, wasn't very often.' The blue eyes of lonely Mary Miles Minter grew moist. 'It wasn't me only that he was good to--he treated everyone that way. 'He didn't have an enemy in the world--I am sure of that. He could only be compared with God--he was so good! 'Before we went to Europe,' said the girlish moving picture star, 'I saw a great deal of Mr. Taylor. 'But--after that'--her voice trailed off in silence. Again she spoke: 'After that I couldn't get him to go anywhere much. He was so interested in his work. He would bury himself in his apartment for days--yes, weeks at a stretch, when he was working on a new picture. 'I don't believe he ever had a wife. He never told me he had. And our acquaintance was such that I am sure he wouldn't deceive me--no, he wouldn't. 'I cannot believe Mr. Taylor is dead. I pinch myself to wake up--I feel that I am dreaming. 'Oh, that I could wake up and know that I had a horrible nightmare--how happy I would be!'

Army records and papers found yesterday in the home of William D. Taylor, according to officials of the Lasky company, prove that the murdered motion-picture director was at least a lieutenant in the British forces. Among the army records found, a pass of leave from duty in Dunkirk, dated April 4, 1919, shows that William D. Taylor was at that time a lieutenant in the British forces. An embarkation ticket bearing the name of William D. Taylor, according to the Lasky officials, shows that the director was a lieutenant, and also shows the army number F-56979, and regiment E.F.C., R.A.S.C. It is further stated that Mr. Taylor was discharged with the rank of captain.

Mabel Normand's missing letters to William Desmond Taylor, slain film director, have been found. A dainty handkerchief with the initials 'M.M.M.' in a corner--apparently a keepsake of Mr. Taylor--also has been recovered. The letters, about which an investigation has been conducted for several days, were written by the famous screen actress during her friendship with the noted director, who had directed such stars as Mary Miles Minter, Mary Pickford, Betty Compson and others. Miss Normand has attempted to recover these letters, which she stated were in the possession of Mr. Taylor before his murder a week ago Wednesday night shortly after Miss Normand left his home. The officers have made every effort to find them. Yesterday the police search was rewarded when a packet of letters, admittedly written by Miss Normand, was found in a boot in Mr. Taylor's closet. The find was made during a search of the place by Captain of Detectives Adams and his aides, Detective Sergeants Cahill, Herman Cline, Cato and Murphy. Charles Eyton, manager of the Famous Players-Lasky studio, to whom Mr. Taylor was under a two-year contract, said last night that he was at the house when the letters were found, but was not present in the upstairs room when the actual discovery was made. E. C. Jessurund [sic], proprietor of the apartment court in which Mr. Taylor lived, was present, Mr. Eyton said. The letters comprised a large packet and from statements made by Chief Dep. Dist. Atty. Doran yesterday it was understood the District Attorney's office came into possession of them. Miss Normand was an intimate friend of Mr. Taylor and during times when she was in New York and he was here she wrote to him, she said, in explaining her desire to get the letters. She stated she wished to have them because she feared that some of the terms used in them might be misconstrued, although she and Mr. Taylor understood there was no serious love affair. The handkerchief, which was kept among other personal effects of Mr. Taylor, was found by Henry Peavey, negro houseman, who found his employer's body last Thursday morning. 'Here's the handkerchief all you boys have been bothering about,' Peavey says he announced. It was taken from him by the detectives and placed with the other personal effects that may have a bearing on the solution of the crime. From statements Peavey had previously made about seeing the handkerchief many weeks before the murder, however, it is believed, it has no direct bearing on the problem of who killed Mr. Taylor.

...An asserted love cult, an organization of mysterious ways and membership, yesterday was reported to attaches of the District Attorney's office, and is under investigation now. Mr. Taylor is declared to have been on intimate terms with the members, if, indeed, he was not one of the cult's followers. A touch of oriental mysticism was included in the report given to the investigators... ...Mr. Manning turned over to the police the report from Arizona concerning Sands. The message from Tucson, reads as follows: 'Walter Peterson, on way to Imperial, Cal., care of H. H. Peterson, Imperial, feels certain he met Edward F. Sands at Lowell, Ariz., February 4 and 5. Description same as Los Angeles newspapers of February 7, also wore dark suit with light pin stripe, plain yellow shirt; brown shoes; soft brown hat. Sands told him he was a deserter from the British navy, and was machine- gun man for Pancho Villa. Had been in New York, British Columbia, Alaska, Los Angeles and Hollywood. (Signed) 'B. F. Daniels 'Sheriff' ...A final search of the Taylor home, conducted yesterday by Detectives Cline, Cato and Cahill while Public Administrator Bryson was removing the possessions from the apartment disclosed a bank-book belonging to Sands. This book, showing he had made deposits in a Los Angeles bank, was found behind a book case. A business card, apparently dropped in the house, also was found. A check on the person whose name appeared thereon is being made although it was regarded as probable that the card had been there some time before Mr. Taylor was shot to death. Undersheriff Biscailuz late in the day admitted the Sheriff's office is working hard on three 'leads' tending to connect prominent film people with the slaying. The Sheriff's office holds little credence in the theory that Sands committed the crime. Information in the hands of the police detectives, however, indicate that Sands was near the scene of the crime about the time of the shooting, which is officially believed to have been about 7:50 or 7:55 p.m. a week ago yesterday. He also has been reported from reliable sources to have been in Los Angeles both before and after that day.

POLICE SAY FACTS IN TAYLOR MURDER ARE NOT REVEALED . Allege Movie People Are Suppressing information to Save industry. POINT TO MISSING LETTERS Theory is Now Advanced That Woman May have Shot Film Director While Embracing him. ANOTHER MAN QUESTIONED Slain Director's Property is Taken over to Arrange for a Settlement of the Estate. Special to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES,Cal., Feb. 8. Police and county detectives investigating the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery have arrived simultaneously at the conclusion that some facts are being suppressed. Some of Taylor's associates are believed to know more about the murder than they are telling. The reason for this secrecy is believed to be the desire to protect the movie industry from scandal. A new theory of the murder was advanced today and received some consideration at the Sheriff' s office. It is that Taylor was shot by a woman whom he was embracing and who had her arms around him. The theory is based on the position of the bullet found in his back and the fact that Taylor is thought to have his arms raised when he was killed. Rage, because she had been scorned by the Director, is the motive imputed to the woman. The mysterious disappearance of telegrams and letters from Mabel Normand, which she says were kept in a bureau drawer by Taylor, has not yet been cleared up. Among the telegrams from Miss Normand to Taylor were believed to have been a number sent by the comedienne in Los Angeles in 1919, when Taylor was "on location" in Massachusetts with one of the Famous Players producing units. Addressed to "Captain" Taylor. These telegrams were said to have been addressed to "Captain" Taylor. Taylor was known by a military title for some time after his discharge from the British Army. The exchange of wires was said to have been an attempt to patch up a disagreement between them arising over the attentions one was bestowing on a third member of the picture colony. Miss Normand was starring in "The Slim Princess," George Ade's picture, in 1919. it was made at the Goldwyn studios. Victor Schertzinger was Miss Normand's director. Taylor at the time was directing Mary Miles Minter in "Ann of Green Gables," made in Massachusetts. A new figure was drawn, within the scope of investigation of the case, when operatives of the District Attorney's office, it is learned, made efforts today to question one of the biggest independent figures in the motion picture business. This man, recently divorced, was said to have been madly in love with an actress who apparently held Taylor in higher esteem. He is reported to have proposed marriage on numerous occasions to the actress whose silken nightgown police detectives assert they found in Taylor's home shortly after he was shot. "Some one is going to be arrestedand suddenly-for the Taylor murder," UnderSheriff Eugene Biscail said today. "And it will not be Edward F. Sands, Taylor's missing valet. Taylor was killed through jealousy and not revenge," A fight to save the professional reputation of Mary Miles Minter was started today by her friends. Hollywood's financiers, dealt a severe blow in the Arbuckle case, are resolved that no more screen prestige in which thousands of dollars have been invested shall be lost. Several financiers met her attorneys today at her home, Behind drawn curtains, while private detectives stood guard to keep outsiders away, the conference continued during the night. Mabel Normand, who fainted at Taylor's funeral yesterday, expected to be the director's wife, according to Henry Peavey, negro valet of the murdered director. She told me," said Peavey to police detectives, " that she and Mr. Tayior were going to be married." Miss Normand Denies Engagement. Miss Normand. who was in a state bordering on collapse at her home today denied again that she and Taylor were ever engaged. The District Attorney's office has received a letter from a woman describing a meeting between two mysterious men driving two automobiles at a street corner the night of the killing. One was heard to say to the other: " Now that we've got him we're in for it." Both were so muffled up that their features were indistinguishable. They parted going in different directions. One of them dropped a strip of film showing the Grand Canyon with the caption "A deep and brooding mystery seems to hover over this great scar on the face of nature." Detectives are going over film found in Taylor's home to see whether this was taken from his collection. A complaint charging Sands with the murder was to be issued today by the District Attorney's office. William Doran, Chief Deputy District Attorney said there was no doubt in his mind that Sands is the guilty man. The former secretary has been a fugitive from justice for several months, charged with grand larceny and forgery. Another love letter to Taylor has been found in the effects of the murdered man. It is written in a simple schoolgirl cipher. and the translation is reproduced, except for the last paragraph: "What shall I call you, you wonderful man? You are standing on the lot, the idol of an adoring company. You have just come over and put your coat on my chair. I want to go away with you, up in the hills or anywhere, just so we'd be alone-all alone. In a beautiful little woodland lodge you'd be cook (as I can only make tea), and fetch the water and build the fire. Move to Settle Estate, Public Administrator Bryson, together with several deputies, went to the slain man's house today to remove his personal effects that the estate might be settled. Clothing, books, a phonograph and piano and various papers were taken into custody. Mr. Bryson stated that there were not papers of material interest in those that he took. He stated that the police and the District Attorney had been through them prior to his office taking charge and that any papers of value were removed by them. The estate, it was stated, would not total more than $20,000 unless unknown safety deposit boxes or bank accounts in his name are found. It is believed that there is a sum in a New York bank but investigations thus far have failed to reveal it. In Mr: Taylor's effects are several hundred canceled ohecks. Many of them are for ioans and are endorsed with the names prominent in the motion picture world. Bills, both paid and unpaid, were found. No word has been recelved concerning the disposition of the yaluables, and they will be kept in storage until the entire estate can be checked up. As no other heirs are in evidence, Mr. Bryson stated that Mr. Taylor's daughter will be the recipient.

(Los Angeles)--The dynamic energy of the police in the fruitless search for the solution of the mysterious murder of William Desmond Taylor was exceeded today by the massed and hurricane activity of the kings of the film industry to ring down the curtain on the unceasing flow of scandal that has surrounded the tragedy. The police centered their search on meager clues that ended in blind alleys--mysterious pink nighties that disappear--initialed handkerchiefs that cannot be found--hints of secret loves of beautiful and unnamed women stars-- rejected lovers--scented love letters-- The chain is endless. Throughout Hollywood the great men of the industry were closeted with men and women idols of the screen, making every effort to hush up the scandal. Giddy parties in the fast road house resorts have been cancelled. The lights of the white light cabarets no longer shine on decolleted and shimmy loving women of the screen.

Navy Forwards Fall Data On Man Resembling Sands The complete description, finger prints and specimens of the handwriting of a naval deserter believed by naval officials to resemble closely Edward F. Sands, missing butlersecretary, wanted by Los Angeles police in connection with the killing of William Desmond Taylor, motion-picture cirector, were sent to the police of the California city yesterday by Rear Admiral Thomas Washington, chief of the bureau of navigation of the Navy Department. The bureau of navigation, in transmitting its information to the Los Angeles police, made this explanation: "While the bureau cannot say with certainty that this is the man you desire apprehended, it was thought so long as the description of Strathmore was so close to that of Sands it would be advisable for you to have this information for use in making your investigation." The naval career of the deserter considered as possibly being Sands was a hectic one, according to Navy Department records, including a dishonorable discharge for embezzlement, two fraudulent reenlistments and two desertions, all within a period of eight years. Names used by the deserter included Edward Fitzgerald Snyder of Marion, Ohio, and Edward Fitz William Strathmore, of Boston, Mass.

DEATH CLEWS HIDDEN ylor's Body "Arranged" Before Police Came, Is Charge. SEARCH FOR SANDS PRESSED Officials say "Influences" Hinder progress in Murder Inquiry. Chauffeur Reports Having Heard Miss Normand and Slain Direcor Quarrel-Actress Denies Letters Have Been Returned to Her. Miss Minter Remains Secluded. County to Start New Quiz Today. (By the Associated Press.) Los Angeles, Calif., Feb. 8.-A statement that the body of William Desmond Taylor, slain motion picture director, had been placed in order before the police arrived to investigate the tragedy was made by F. Parsons, a member of the "flying quadron" of police which answers rry calls, the police allowed it to be known today. The report Parsons gave his superiors said the body had been carefully "laid out" on the floor of Taylor's apartments, and a chair overturned across his legs. His report said by attaches of the district Atorney's office, to have "interested" them very much. Parsons, with Detective Thomas Zeigler, reached the scene before any other officers. Further investigation of the killing to be centralized in the district Attorneys office, it was announced. It was believed this centralization would result in the breaking down of "the conspiracy of silence" the police declared existed on the part of the motion picture people concerning details essential to the apprehension of the assailant. Still Looking for Sands. The blank wall, which, they said, unidentified infiuences appear to have grown up between them and the ue facts remains unpierced. although the police department and the office of the sheriff were attempting to make separate breaches through it into new fields of inquiry. Announcement was made that there would be a investigation of reports that attemps had been made to suppress information concerning the case. The police continued to concentrate their efforts upon search for Edward F. Sands, former secretary and butler for Taylor, missing since Taylor made a charge of grand larceny against him last August. Capt. David L. Adams, head of the detective bureau, reiterated that "there is no one else to we want and have discovered nothing that would indicate a motive for the crime except that of averting prosecution on the grand larceny charge." Suspect in Arizona. Late today the detective bureau received through the sheriff's office a message from the sheriff at Tucson, Ariz., to the effect that a man resembling Sands was seen at Lowell, Ariz., February 4, three days after Taylor was slain. The sheriff's office here, according to the deputies working on the case, up to tonight, had wound up at a "blank wall" in every step it had taken. This investigation, it was said, had nothing to do with Sands. Included in these obstacles were the disappearance of bits of evidence, including letters written to Mr. Taylor by Mary Miles Minter and Mabel Normand, and which were believed to have been in his home when he was shot. These letters were gone immediately after the shooting, and reports yesterday said they had been returned to the writers by some unofficial agency. Miss Normand denied that she had received her letters. Miss Minter was in seclusion, her residence guarded by detectives, but a denial was issued for her also. Initial Handkerchief doneAnother disappearing clew was a handkerchief initialed "S," but which the police did not believe was the property of Edward F. Sands, former houseman, now sought in connection with the case. The police said they believed this handkerchief belonged to a motion picture producer, and they wanted it so they would have something tangible with which to I confront him as a basis for interrogation. Former efforts to end the wide pubCONTINUED ON NINTH PAGSE. DEATH CLEWS HIDDEN CONTINUED FROM FIRST PAGE. Publicity given the case and those connected with it were also intensified, representatives of Miss Minter especially seeking to prevent publication of the fact that her home was under guard. The disappearance from Taylor's home of a woman's pink silk night dress, which was said by Henry Peavey, houseman, to have been kept there, was another item in the list of occurrences deterrent to the investigation and vigorous efforts was being made to find out what became of it. Peavy to be Quizzed. The sheriff's investigators said they expected to examine Henry Peavey, house man for Taylor, in an effort to obtain corroboration or denial of certain statements made to them by other parties, and that possibly some light would be thrown on the situation by this. Peavy passed the day assisting officers in checking over Taylor's effects at the apartment where the slaying occurred. These articles were taken, after the checking, to a storage warehouse under the direction of the public administrator. The police took charge of certain articles, as possibly having some bearing on the killing, but did not state what they were. After the search, Capt. Adams said there had been no letters discovered and that he never had seen any letters adressed to Taylor with the exception of a half dozen from the director's former wife and daughter. These, he declared, had absolutely no bearing upon the case. Mabel Normand and Mary Miles Minter. motion picture actresses. friends of the slain director. who have been questioned about the case, remained in seclusion today. Both police and sheriff's investigators said late in the afternoon no further information had been sought from them. Navy Department Sends Dates. While Associated Press dispatches from Washington announced the Navy Department had forwarded to the police descriptions of a deserter from the navy who had used the name Strathmore, which was known to have been used by Sands, the police said they had no direct information from the department. They professed anxiety to get the official description, saying they could makes good use of it. The Los Angeles Examiner today published an unsigned letter found among Taylor's effects, in which the writer painted a vivid word picture of an imaginary life with Taylor in "a beautiful woodland lodge, where they would be alone." The letter told how the writer would cook, sweep and dust while Taylor "fetched the water and built the fire." How she would feed the birds and wait patiently darning socks for him to come home at night and how in the evenings they would sit cozily by the fire listening to the wind whistling outside." It frequently referred to Taylor as "you wonderful man." Part of the letter was withheld by the Examiner. Quarrel With Miss Normand. A quarrel between Taylor and Mabel Normand was described by Harry Fellows, chauffeur for Taylor, according to the Los Angeles Examiner today. "I was driving Mr. Taylor and Miss Normand from the Ambassador hotel, where they had attended a New Year's eve party, to her home." Fellows is reported to have said. "On the way they had a quarrel. I don't know what it was about, but both were very much excited. Mr. Taylor took Miss Normand home and then returned to his apartment. Upon arriving there he broke down and wept. On the following morning he did up some jewelry in a package and took it to Miss Normand at her home." Harry Peavey, negro houseman for Taylor, who found the slain director's body, confirmed Fellow's statements. Murderer Acted Quickly. Fellows said that Taylor and Miss Normand were "very affectionate." Fellows left Taylor's house at 4:30 o'clock Wednesday afternoon, on the night of which Taylor was slain. He was instructed to be sure the telephone at 7:30 o'clock, he said. He said that he telephoned from a girl's house at 7:55 o'clock, and there being no answer from Taylor 's home, he went there. He reached the Taylor place at 8:15 o'clock, and rang the bell and knocked at the door. There was no response, so he put up the car and went home. "I am satisfied that I am the man Mrs. Douglas MacLean saw standing on the porch and leaving the house," Fellows said. "I wore a cap and overcoat." Miss Normand had informed the police that she left Taylor between 7:30 and 7:45 o'clock and, with Fellows telephoning at 7:55 o'clock. It is indicated that the murder was committed between 7:30 and 7:55 o'clock. The Los Angeles county district attorney 's office will begin investigation of the tragedy on its own account tomorrow, it was stated by an official of that office late today. Up to this time activities of the office had been confined to assistance it has given the city police department. In the new investigation evry angle of the case will be taken up, and motion-picture people and others heretofore questioned will be sought for additional information, it was said.

Goldwyn Denies Producers Suppressing Tragedy Facts New York, Feb. 9 Reports that motion picture producers were attempting to suppress the true facts in the recent slaying in Los Angeles of William Desmond Taylor, director, "are too absurd to warrant comment," Samuel Goldwyn. of the Goldwyn Pictures Corporation, said today. The public should realize, he added, that the picture industry, like any other, is made up "of all sorts of people and that being a moving picture man or woman is no more indication of character than being a plumber, steel man, a merchant or what not."
