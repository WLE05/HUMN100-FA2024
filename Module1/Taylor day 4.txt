...Taylor appeared in Telluride when apparently at the end of one of the low ebbs of his financial endeavors. He acted as night clerk for the New Sheridan Hotel there from June 10, 1910, until December 15, of the same year.

The assassination of William Desmond Taylor, Wednesday night, postponed forever an engagement which the film director had with Antonio Moreno, film star, on Thursday morning. When Moreno talked with Taylor over the telephone Wednesday night, about 7 o'clock, Taylor was in the best of spirits, according to Moreno's story told yesterday. But when the time came for the appointment to be fulfilled the following morning, between 10 and 10:30 o'clock, the film director's corpse lay in a local undertaking company's morgue, pierced by a murderer's bullet. Moreno said yesterday that he had been an intimate friend of Taylor for several years, since the time Taylor had become associated with the old Vitagraph Company at Santa Monica in 1914. 'He was one of the finest men I ever met,' 'Tony' said. 'He had the highest ideals, I believe, of any man I've ever met in the profession.' Details of a dinner party which he attended with Taylor, Miss Betty Francisco and Miss Claire Windsor, at the Ambassador Hotel Thursday night, January 27, were given by Moreno, as well as an informal meeting held between Moreno, Taylor, Arthur Hoyt and a Captain Robinson [sic], January 28, at Moreno's room at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. 'I left them there about 7 o'clock,' Moreno said, 'to go to a dinner party at the Ambassador, which I had arranged for a friend visiting here from Chicago. Later, I understand, the three went to dinner at a roadhouse between Los Angeles and Pasadena--I do not know its name--and then on to the Annandale Club after dinner, finally going to Taylor's home.' Moreno declared he had spent about two hours last Monday with Taylor at the Vitagraph studio, where Moreno is working. He had an appointment with him for Tuesday, also, but the director, according to Moreno, did not fill it because of a trip to Mount Lowe on location. 'Then I called him again Wednesday night,' Moreno said, 'about 6 o'clock. His boy, Henry, answered the phone. Mr. Taylor was not at home. However, he called me later, about 7, and we arranged that I should call for Mr. Taylor, at the Lasky studio, about 10 o'clock Thursday morning. Mr. Hoyt was with me in my room at the time. Mr. Taylor was to go with me to the Vitagraph studio, on a matter of personal business.' 'But--' and here Moreno gave a sorrowful shake of his head--'But you know the rest. The appointment was not fulfilled--and never will be. 'I feel that in Mr. Taylor's death I've lost one of the best friends I've ever know. And I'll do everything in my power to run down the man who killed him.'

Out of the tangled lives of two brothers, deputy sheriffs last night were endeavoring to find the secret of the death of William D. Taylor. Both had been married; both were fathers; both had everything to hold them at home. But both mysteriously disappeared from their homes and their old haunts. One is dead, after a reappearance in a new land--the West--and died in the glory of a success in his chosen field. The other has never reappeared--unless in some way the other brother is connected with the murder of William D. Taylor. The amazing story of a double life, as told exclusively in the city additions of The Examiner yesterday from the lips of Mrs. Ada Deane-Tanner, sister-in-law of the dead man, was elaborated upon yesterday by her. Reports had reached officials here yesterday from the East and from San Francisco that Mrs. Deane-Tanner had not married Dennis, the brother, but had married William, the director, who was murdered here last Wednesday night. This Mrs. Deane-Tanner yesterday emphatically denied, in her modest Monrovia home, in East Lemon street, just around the corner from the home of Coroner Willis O. Nance. 'I can prove,' she said, 'that I am not the director's widow. I am his sister-in-law. I have a marriage license here somewhere which shows I married Dennis, not William. The records in New York City will show separate licenses on separate years for the marriages of Dennis and William. Dr. Pomeroy, the county health officer, by brother-in-law, knew Dennis, my husband, and can tell you he is not the man shown in photographs as the famous director.' This was her convincing story, told in a whisper from the couch, where she lay ill from the shock of the tragedy and the sudden forcing of her and her history into the glaring limelight. Mrs. Deane-Tanner admitted to The Examiner yesterday for the first time that she had divorced her husband in Los Angeles six years ago. The divorce, she said, was granted by Superior Judge Charles Monroe on the grounds of desertion and nonsupport. At the time of the divorce case, Mrs. Deane-Tanner said, she recited, in brief, the story of the mysteriously disappeared husband and as there was no contest the divorce was granted. At the time, however, no mention of the relationship between this unknown woman and the famous director was made and even her relationship to Mrs. Pomeroy was not known. In a large way, backing up and corroborating the story told by the old woman, was the story given to The Examiner by Dr. Pomeroy himself. 'I cannot say for sure,' stated the county official, 'that William Desmond Taylor was not Dennis Gage Deane-Tanner. 'But I can hardly believe that they were one and the same man. 'I've seen pictures of the murdered man, though to my knowledge I never saw him in the flesh, and this man is not the man I knew in New York as my relative by marriage.' Dr. Pomeroy admitted that he had naturally not seen Dennis Deane-Tanner since his disappearance in New York years ago, but he stated that he has a good recollection on his appearance and that he was unquestionably not William. 'I never saw the two brothers together,' he continued, 'and in fact, I never saw the elder brother, William. But there must have been two brothers, as Dennis frequently mentioned William. I met him several times in the East.' Dr. Pomeroy also corroborated his sister-in-law's story that she had employed detective agencies to search for her husband when he disappeared, but that no trace of the man had ever been found. The theory of certain officers that for the solution of the crime the investigators should go back to New York, 1912, instead of Los Angeles, 1922, met with little enthusiasm from Mrs. Deane-Tanner yesterday, although she admitted that in the mysterious past of the two brothers some common motive might be linked. 'I am more inclined to believe,' she said, 'that the solution of the crime lies in some quarrel or misunderstanding of recent origin--something growing out of the associations he has formed since coming to this Coast. Somehow I can't believe that the disappearance of my husband and William's disappearance had any connection, and though I wouldn't at all be surprised to learn that my former husband is still alive, I can't believe that he could possibly be connected with his brother's death in any way--even as a possible fellow victim.' The sister-in-law of the murdered man made light of a theory that some old English feud might have been behind the mystery in the lives of both brothers--some overwhelming tragedy which, if disclosed, would make trivial the astounding revelations so far before the public. Mrs. Deane-Tanner's elaborated story of her relationship in this maze of tangled lives is as follows: 'My maiden name was Ada C. Brennan. I was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. C. K. Brennan of New York. Both my parents are dead. 'I was married to Denis Gage Deane-Taylor [sic], a man considerably smaller than his brother, though of similar general appearance, in 1907 in New York. 'By that marriage I had two daughters, Muriel, now 14, and Alice, now 12 years old. 'In 1912 I had lung trouble and my husband sent me to the Adirondack Mountains for a rest cure. When I had been there a week I suddenly received a telegram from my mother in the metropolis to come home at once. I immediately took a train for the city and when I arrived I learned that my husband had disappeared. 'We hunted high and low for him. We employed detectives and did every manner of things possible to make likely his discovery, but in vain. To this day I have never heard from or heard of my husband. 'After futile waiting and wondering and heart-broken nights trying to live until the next hard day of raising two children, fatherless, I sued for divorce and was awarded a decree. 'During the time I was married I became very friendly with Mrs. Frederick Young of New York. She was the former wife of Edward Thaw, a half brother of Harry K. Thaw. 'I was also a good friend of Ethel Putnam, daughter of George H. Putnam, and her sister, Dorothy; one year on a tour of Europe stopped at Kent, England, to visit Mr. Deane-Tanner's family. Thus I learned something of William Deane-Tanner, though I met him personally but several times in my life. 'Both these sisters finally were married and I have lost track of them-- don't even know their names now. 'Finally, after futile searches for my husband, I and my children moved to Monrovia, to stay at the home of my sister, Mrs. Pomeroy, at 240 East Palm street, and after they moved, I came to this address. 'My husband, while with me in New York, worked for A. S. Vernay, 12 East Forty-Fifth street, as an interior decorator, and when he disappeared Mr. Vernay could find no business reason for his having done so. His books, as were his brothers books four years before on his disappearance, were perfect and his work had been most satisfactory, Mr. Vernay said. 'On November 28, 1915, here at Monrovia, I was notified that Mrs. Young, my friend, had died and had left to me a bequest which amounted to roughly $1000 a year for life. With other moneys I had, this annuity would have made it possible for me to have taken care of my children amply for life, but through litigation, on some technicality, I never was able to get my bequest. 'Mrs. Young died on November 6, 1915, and her estate was compared to be of some $1,000,000. We had always been good friends and she was most kind to me at all times. 'In the letter advising me of the bequest it was stated that as soon as the estate was settled I would receive the money quarterly.' Turning back to her brother-in-law, now dead, she went on: 'My first child, Muriel, was born in New York city in 1908, in November, and after her birth I met my brother-in-law for the first time. Denis' brother came up to see me and his little niece, but we talked only a short time. He was considerably larger than Denis, but similar to him in general appearance, as I have said. 'From then on I saw him only occasionally. 'His disappearance, the talk of the town at that time, however, I shall not easily forget. 'It was the day of the notable Vanderbilt Cup race on Long Island, in November, 1908. William had witnessed the race, and had been seen there by scores of his friends, as he was popular. 'The next day the earth had swallowed him. He was gone, had disappeared and it was several years before he was heard from again, and then only indirectly. 'His wife, the former Ethel Hamilton, Floradora girl, was devoted to him and they had but few quarrels, but her grief was no greater than my husband's at his brother's loss. 'He was inconsolable and for months though of nothing else. If he had any suspicion of how and why his brother had gone he never whispered a word of it to me and I never for a moment thought, or think now, that he knew. 'That there was anything in their mutual past that could have caused this tragedy I cannot believe. 'Of course, William's relations with his wife, which I have referred to, I knew only by gossip, but naturally took it at the time at its face value.' Before her death, Mrs. Young made a trip to California and while here learned that William Deane-Tanner, known as William D. Taylor, was at work in motion pictures and 'was doing well,' according to Mrs. Deane-Tanner's story. 'Petey' he was known then, and apparently when Mrs. Young communicated this information to the former show girl in New York, Taylor's wife, she was surprised to learn that the girl already knew of her husband's whereabouts and was not surprised to learn that Taylor was here in pictures under a new name. Nevertheless, it was a shock to the Deane-Tanner's friends there, because the young wife was not supposed to know anything of her husband's whereabouts. Mrs. Ada Deane-Tanner's attempts to interview Taylor, the director, on her arrival here, his denial of identity, and his finally sending her an allowance, though still denying that he was related to her, was told exclusively in yesterday's Examiner and this story was not changed in the least by the sister-in-law yesterday. His letter to her, telling her that he would send her the money, Mrs. Deane-Tanner said, she still had and would produce, with the marriage license only if forced to by the authorities, saying that she saw no reason for doing so. Mrs. Deane-Tanner in Monrovia yesterday was being advised by several men, one connected with a bank there and the other an attorney, but neither of these men would make a statement. Being ill, she was attended by a neighbor and her children were being taken care of elsewhere. Miss Kate Collins, principal of the Wild Rose school in Monrovia, where the two children attended, was high in her praise of the two kiddies. She said she remembered when the Deane-Tanners arrived there, because of their relationship to Mrs. Pomeroy, but had no knowledge until reading The Examiner yesterday of her relationship to the film director. Both Muriel and Alice, she said, were among the brightest in their classes, Muriel being in the eighth grade and Alice in the sixth. Both she described as always cheerful and anxious to help others, and Alice, she said, is of the 'smiley' type, always with a cheerful grin greeting her friends and teachers. One of the girls, Muriel, is said to have a marked resemblance to her murdered uncle, both Mrs. Deane-Tanner and one of her advisers said yesterday. Chief of Police E. A. Bovee of Monrovia, is taking an active interest in the case, giving the sheriff's office all help possible in his end.

...[telling of Henry Peavey on the witness stand at the inquest] 'What did you see?' 'I saw his feet, and I said 'Mr. Taylor'--just like that. Then I saw his face, and I turned and run out and yelled. And then I yelled some more--' And then Henry broke into high pitched laughter as he recalled his fright and terror. Laughed as he thought of himself going in and speaking to a dead man. It was a huge joke--no doubt about it. And the joke was on him. Of course, He laughed and those in the room laughed with him...

Denver, Feb. 4--A clew uncovered her today suggests the possibility that the murder of William Desmond Tanner Taylor was a case of mistaken identity. Coupled with the statement of friends of Taylor that he was a genial soul, without a known enemy in the world, the theory that he was murdered by a person who though he was someone else becomes probable. This new angle on the case was furnished by Judge Ben B. Lindsey of the Juvenile Court, who became intimate with Taylor during the filming of 'The Soul of Youth,' a picture which Taylor directed and in which Judge Lindsey was featured. Lindsey said that Taylor had told him of his experiences in Denver ten years ago, when the famous director was a mining engineer working at Ouray. On one of his frequent visits to Denver, Taylor told Lindsey he had been mistaken for another man by a policeman and placed under arrest. When Taylor protested and affirmed that he was not the man in question, the policeman attacked him with his club and beat him severely. He was lodged in the city jail over night. Taylor's story continued, but in the morning was able to establish his identity and was released with profuse apologies. He never learned the name of the man he was mistaken for and was booked merely 'For investigation.' Was Taylor the walking image of some underworld character? Was he murdered for revenge by some crook whom his double had betrayed? Did he know his own double and was he slain by the man he looked like to prevent his informing the police of the caller's actions? These are questions which the authorities will have to solve in their investigations of the film director's mysterious murder. Judge Lindsey himself did not suggest the possibility of Taylor's being slain my mistake. He appeared quite perplexed about a motive for the crime, describing Taylor as one of the kindliest and most gentle men he had ever known. By a coincidence he was reading a letter from Louis Sargent, who played the leading juvenile role in 'The Soul of Youth' when he learned of the director's death. 'Don't you wish we could appear together again in one of Mr. Taylor's pictures?' wrote Louis. Scarcely a moment later Mrs. Lindsey entered the judge's room and informed him of Taylor's murder. 'William Desmond Taylor was one of the finest types of gentlemen I ever met,' said Judge Lindsey today. 'He was not the type of man one would connect with scandal in the movies. I don not believe that anything will develop from this tragedy to throw discredit upon his character. 'He was a scholarly man, patient, kindly, and gentle. Perhaps his quiet disposition may have developed the impression of his being a 'mystery man.' I do not believe there is any mystery to his discredit. 'It was in May, 1920, that I was with him almost daily while we were working together on a moving picture called 'The Soul of Youth,' in which I consented to do the part of a judge of a juvenile court. During this time I met him frequently at the studio and a number of times at the office. 'He was interested in the boy problem, as shown by his productions of 'Tom Sawyer,' 'Huckleberry Finn' and 'The Soul of Youth.' I watched his work at the studio with children, and I used to tell him he would make an excellent juvenile court judge because he had such marvelous patience and could get so much out of children. I suppose that is the reason he got so much out of the stars among the women whom he had successfully directed, including Mary Pickford, Mary Miles Minter, Elsie Ferguson and others. 'He had been the means of helping one little girl whom I once knew in this court and was always glad to acknowledge any of my letters about young people I knew in connection with the movies. 'The last I heard of him was about the first of the year, when he sent me a little Christmas and New Year message.'

...Late last night Detective Captain Adams, after a three hour conference with Mary Miles Minter, issued an official statement in which he said, 'Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill, together with myself, interviewed Miss Minter. We talked with her several hours regarding her relations with Taylor. We are absolutely satisfied that Miss Minter knows nothing that will throw any light at all on this mystery nor do we believe that she is even remotely connected with the case.' It was rumored late last night that Edward F. Sands, discharged secretary of William Desmond Taylor, who has been sought as a material witness in the slaying of Taylor, had been found, questioned and placed in secret custody... Another man was being looked for last night in the person of a man whose reputation has been none too savory. While there is no direct evidence implicating him, he is one of those persons coming within that classification so frequently described in blunt police comment, 'I wouldn't put it past him.' Possible suspicion would not have turned in his direction but it had been noted by some of this fellow's acquaintances that he had not been seen in his familiar haunts since the murder. He is described as a man much easier to find than to lose and the picture colony has been whispering about him. George Contreras of the district attorney's investigating staff, and Deputy Sheriffs Fox, Nolan and Bell, who yesterday entered the case, were in a search for this man last night. If he is not the actual murderer they expect him to tell a story which will materially advance the investigation. An earlier development of the day, however, struck the picture colony with more amazement that this feature. It was the report that one of the big figures of the screen, a man whose sudden rise to fame has been one of the marvels of the profession, was under suspicion. His name was first linked with the crime as a possibility to be considered because he had been paying marked attention to an actress who is known to have been one of Taylor's most intimate friends. Then came the reminder that the man in question answers the physical characteristics of the assassin whom Mrs. Douglas MacLean saw leaving Taylor's apartment shortly after a shot had been heard. It was further recalled that this man often wore a dark silk scarf, such as that figuring in Mrs. MacLean's description, and also a cap. However, it was learned last night that this man had voluntarily offered to account for every minute of his time on Wednesday night. It is stated in this connection that the actor has explained a telephone conversation he had with Taylor two days before the murder. The woman whose name has been mentioned professes entire ignorance as to both the motive and the facts of the crime... Captain Adams yesterday declared that an arrest would be made within twenty-four hours, probably less. 'Working secretly, and while the suspected murderer believed that suspicion was falling on another person,' he said, 'detectives from my office have woven a chain of evidence that we believe is unbreakable. 'The net of evidence about this man is tightening like the inexorable tentacles of a deep sea monster. The motive has been established, the activities of the suspect have been checked to the night of the murder and detectives will locate his hiding place easily when the links in the chain are complete. 'A woman may have been, and possibly was, the indirect cause of the crime, but no woman directed the murderer in this case.'

William D. Taylor appeared to be in the best of health and spirits about one hour before he was shot down in his own apartment at 404-B South Alvarado Street. He did not appear to have any premonition of what lay in store for him, although, according to the police theory of the slaying of the film director, the murderer was then lurking in the shadows a few feet away from Mr. Taylor. This was disclosed yesterday by Tony Moreno, Vitagraph star. Mr. Moreno's story of his conversations with the slain director on the night of the murder and for a week prior to the shooting, furnish an important check on Mr. Taylor's movement for at least seven days preceding the shooting. 'I played golf with Mr. Taylor exactly a week before his death. We drove to the San Gabriel Country Club and remained there from about noon till dark. While there I introduced him to Asa Keyes, the Deputy District Attorney.' Mr. Moreno said yesterday at his apartment, in the Los Angeles Athletic Club. 'The next day I saw him again. I met him at the Ambassador at a party. Mr. Taylor was with Miss Claire Windsor. I saw him leave the hotel with her. There were a number of picture people there that night. 'Saturday night--that is, a week ago tonight--Mr. Taylor was here in the club. He was in my room and with us were Arthur Hoyt and Capt. Robertson, who is a close friend of Mr. Taylor. We sat and talked a while. Then Mr. Taylor, Mr. Hoyt and Capt. Robertson left. Later I learned they drove to Cedar Grove, near Pasadena, and had something to eat there. From there they drove to the Annandale Country Club. 'I saw Mr. Taylor next at the Lasky studios, Monday morning at 10 o'clock. I had an appointment with him to go to the Vitagraph studios, on a matter of business importance to me. Chester Bennett of the Brunton studios, was with us. We were together until 12:30 p.m. that day. 'We were unable to see the people we wanted that day. The appointment had to be made over again. I called Mr. Taylor again, Tuesday at the Lasky lot, but I did not get to talk to him. I was informed that he was out on location on Mt. Lowe. Tuesday, which was the day before the murder, I could not get in touch with him. 'Wednesday night Mr. Taylor called me at the club. I was in Mr. Hoyt's room, when the call came. We discussed the business appointment I wanted Mr. Taylor to participate in. As near as I can now recall it, it was about 7 o'clock when Mr. Taylor called. He did not tell me much about his trip to Mt. Lowe. 'Mr. Hoyt was present at the conversation. It lasted several minutes. Mr. Taylor then made an appointment for Thursday morning, at 10 o'clock. He appeared to be in best of spirits. He was pleasant and cheerful. 'It was a few minutes after 7 that Mr. Taylor hung up. Then Mr. Hoyt and I went to the club dining-room and stayed there for dinner. 'Thursday morning, Mr. Hoyt called me and told me I would not be able to keep the appointment with Mr. Taylor because he was dead. He then told me what he read in the papers.' The investigators last night began to check up the facts supplied by Mr. Moreno in an effort to supply the missing links and thus account for every action and movement of the slain director. Mr. Moreno's story supplied much important data, the officers say.

Missing letters and telegrams sent by Mabel Normand, celebrated film star, to William Desmond Taylor, the famous motion-picture director who was slain last Wednesday night within a few moments after Miss Normand left his home, formed the basis of a separate investigation hinging about the murder mystery last night. Captain of Detectives Adams and Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill last night questioned Mary Miles Minter, also a widely known screen actress, concerning her knowledge of the life of Mr. Taylor. The officers, after a long session with Miss Minter, declared they had uncovered no important new facts. Miss Normand made a personal visit to the home at 404-B South Alvarado street, where Mr. Taylor's body was found, a bullet in his back and she asked for her letters. She went to the top drawer of Mr. Taylor's dresser to get them. They were not there. Captain of Detective Adams told her he did not know where they were. Late last night he repeated the statement. With the officials seeking these letters Charles Eyton, general manager of the Famous Players-Lasky studio and who assumed charges of many of the dead man's personal effects, also stated he did not have them, according to police. The visit of Miss Normand, directly after the Coroner's inquest earlier in the day, was dramatic in many respects. She appeared at the Taylor apartment while Officers Cline, Cahill, Cato and Winn were there with Capt. Adams. Mabel Normand then re-enacted the scene that the officers believe took place shortly before the fatal shot was heard by neighbors within a few minutes after Miss Normand left. She arranged the furniture of the handsomely appointed apartment as it was on the last visit she paid to the director, who has filmed such stars as Mary Pickford, Mary Miles Minter, Betty Compson and others. She showed where the chair that was overturned on Mr. Taylor's legs when the body was found, was standing when she left the home about 7:45 p.m. last Wednesday. She again told of some of the conversation which she and Mr. Taylor had that night. And she showed how Mr. Taylor had escorted her from the court of the apartments to her automobile, in which her chauffeur was sitting... But during this visit, Miss Normand asked for her letters. She said she knew Mr. Taylor kept them in the top drawer of his dresser and there the search was directed in vain. Public Administrator Bryson could not be found all day yesterday but the officers declare that to the best of their knowledge he has not taken charge of the letters. Miss Normand last night said, 'I am surprised that anyone should have been interested in these letters of mine to Mr. Taylor. I am sure there is nothing in them of any interest to the general public. 'There is nothing in them that would help the police in any way. There were some of my letters in Mr. Taylor's room--I would say six or seven and several telegrams I had sent him while I was in New York. 'The letters, too, were those sent by me to Mr. Taylor, when he was in New York or when I was in New York. 'I knew they were in his dresser drawer because he showed them to me once when he showed me over the house immediately after he was robbed. 'On that occasion he happened to open the top drawer of his dresser and I saw the letters. 'I said, 'Why, you're not keeping those letters, are you?' and he made some pleasant remark, saying he was keeping them.' In addition to the mystery of Miss Normand's letters and the efforts of the officers to reconstruct as nearly as possible the scene before the crime investigators from the detective bureau, the District Attorney's office and the Sheriff's office worked well into the night unraveling some of the loose ends of the case. Mary Miles Minter, film luminary and close friend of Mr. Taylor, was reported early yesterday to be confined to her home because of illness. On the morning the murder was discovered she rushed to the Taylor home and became almost hysterical when she confirmed the news of his death. ...Placing the home of a widely known Hollywood man under surveillance late yesterday, officers were searching last night for this man, who is wanted as a material witness. Several new clews, one of which is declared to have placed this man's automobile in the vicinity of the Taylor flat at 404-B South Alvarado street about the time of the slaying, have been uncovered. This man is widely and somewhat unfavorably known among many film celebrities and his name has figured in previous police investigations. His mysterious visits at homes of several members of the film colony are being checked in connection with the new angle. Officers late in the day were watching his home. Vigorous efforts were being made to locate him for questioning. Meanwhile, other officers, particularly Detective Sergeants Yarrow and Mallheau, narcotic traffic experts, turned their attention to another new angle. They started yesterday afternoon to investigate several reports concerning 'dope' traffic in Hollywood and other supposed clews, which tend to indicate that visits of 'peddlers' of dope had been made in that vicinity. A report of a supposed threat made on the night of the murder also was being run down by the officers. This report, made by a downtown business man to the police, was expected to set the officers on the trail of a man who is quoted as saying on the night Mr. Taylor was slain within a few minutes after Mabel Normand, film star, left the Taylor home, 'There will be a movie director show up missing in the morning.' ...Capt. Adams yesterday stated it is not impossible that Mr. Taylor was killed by a burglar, who seized upon the opportunity provided when Mr. Taylor escorted Miss Normand to her automobile to sneak in the house. The position of the bullet and the line of fire indicated shows, Capt. Adams said, that the assassin probably was crouching behind the door when Mr. Taylor entered...

There were no women's tears at the inquest yesterday which determined that William Desmond Taylor came to his death at the hands of an assassin. The only sobs were contributed by Henry Peavey, negro valet and cook, who wailed aloud when he entered the inquest rooms at the Ivy Overholtzer undertaking rooms, where Coroner Nance conducted the hearing. ...Sobs interfered somewhat with Peavey's testimony. He knelt on the floor by the bier first and sobbed aloud and his wails were frequent during the entire hearing...His mourning sounded so much like a guffaw that many smiled, but there were tears in Peavey's eyes...

Denver, Feb. 4--William Desmond Taylor, Los Angeles motion-picture director, may have been murdered by mistake due to his resemblance to a man hated by some underworld avenger. This opinion was given today by Judge Ben B. Lindsey when he learned of Taylor's death at the hands of an assassin. Judge Lindsey said Mr. Taylor told him of having been held all night by Denver police who believed he was a man much wanted. Mr. Taylor said his protestations of innocence caused him to be severely beaten by police clubs. The following morning, after he had established his identity, profuse apologies were extended, but he never learned the name of the man for whom he was mistaken. 'Was he murdered for revenge by some crook whom his double had betrayed?' Judge Lindsey asked. 'He may have been the image of some underworld character.'

The most unfeigned astonishment was expressed yesterday throughout the entire local filmdom over the disclosures made regarding the dual role played in life by William Desmond Taylor, noted film director, who was shot Wednesday night. Both surprise and regret were the feelings expressed in the Mary Miles Minter household. Mrs. Julia B. Miles, Miss Minter's grandmother, said: 'Somehow my faith in human beings is a little shaken this morning because of all people with a shadowy past I would never have suspected Mr. Taylor. In fact I asked him once if he were a bachelor or a widower and he said 'I am a confirmed bachelor,' and as I believed him to be the very essence of truth I naturally felt shocked to learn he had a wife and child. 'My granddaughter, Miss Minter, looked on him as a child might regard a father. She is 19 and he was 55 [sic], and she is an impulsive child and when she heard of his death the other morning she rushed over there and cried all over the place without a thought of having her name dragged into the affair. 'We all liked him and admired him because he was so kind, because he was such a thorough gentleman and such a profound scholar. He was a man of moods, however, sometimes becoming very depressed and gloomy, and one winter when he was directing a picture of Miss Minter's which was being filmed in Boston, he became so despondent that my grand-daughter nicknamed him 'Desperate-Desmond,' just in jest, you know. 'Miss Minter has only seen Mr. Taylor once in the last five months and I was with her at the time. We were driving up Broadway and Mr. Taylor passed us in his car and my grand-daughter said, 'Oh, Mr. Taylor has repainted his car,' and I said, 'Yes, I suppose that man who stole his things tore the car all to pieces. Mr. Taylor stopped and we passed a few friendly greetings with him, but we did not mention any of his troubles with the man who had robbed him, or touch on any of his personal affairs, for while our friendship with him was pleasant and cordial, it was by no means intimate.' Claire Windsor expressed surprise that her name had been connected in any way with that of the dead man. 'I had never been out but once in my life with Mr. Taylor, ' said Miss Windsor, 'and that time it was arranged without my knowledge. Mr. Moreno invited me to join a party of four at the Ambassador and Mr. Taylor was the escort he provided for me. He seemed an extremely reserved and diffident man, but very courteous and dignified, and I liked him.'

William Desmond Taylor, the slain movie director, was well known in this city in 1908. But he was not known as Taylor. He was William Cunningham Deane-Tanner, expert in antiques in those days, and he moved in good society, was well supplied with money from a mysterious source in Ireland and eventually was married to Ethel May Harrison of one of the Floradora Sextettes. Without a word of explanation, according to the woman who was then his wife, he disappeared in 1908. The first Mrs. Deane-Tanner now is the wife of E. L. C. Robins, owner of Robins Restaurant and other hostelries. Mrs. Robins gave out a statement yesterday explaining her marriage and the desertion and her subsequent discovery that her former husband had popped up in the motion picture colony at Hollywood, Cal., and became famous the world over as William Desmond Taylor. She says his murder shocked her and the daughter he abandoned. 'I married, in December, 1901, Mr. William Cunningham Deane-Tanner of Dublin, Ireland,' the statement said. 'He disappeared in October, 1908. We could assign no reason for his disappearance except possibly aphasia. 'In 1912 I got a decree of divorce in the State of New York and was awarded the custody of my only child, Ethel Daisy Deane-Tanner, now 19. 'In August, 1914, I married Edward L. C. Robins. Two and a half weeks later I discovered that William Desmond Taylor had been Mr. Deane-Tanner. I have no further statement which possibly could be of interest. 'The news of Mr. Deane-Tanner's death was a great shock to my daughter and me.' At her home in Orienta Point, Mamaroneck, last night, Mrs. Robins said she held no resentment for the way Deane-Tanner treated her. She presented excuses for him, saying he suffered lapses of memory during the time they lived together and that not long before he vanished, in 1908, he was stricken with facial neuralgia and frequently was in an agony of pain. She does not believe he knew what he was doing the morning he left their home and she supposes that a mental ailment can be held to account for his failure to return. Just as dramatic as were many of the chapters in Deane-Tanner, or William Desmond Taylor's, life was Mrs. Robins's discovery in 1919 that he was still living. With her daughter Mrs. Robins went to a motion picture theater in this city one night. They chose the theater without knowing what picture it was featuring. For several hundred feet of film it was just a new picture as far as they were concerned, but suddenly the hero appeared. Mrs. Robins sank back in her seat too startled to speak. He daughter stood up. For the laughing face on the screen was that of the long missing Deane- Tanner a little changed--somewhat older looking they decided when they finally settled back to wait for the hero's next entry. They sat through the picture and then saw it again and learned that the man whose face they knew was acting and directing movies under the name of William Desmond Taylor. Mrs. Robins said last night that her daughter would not be satisfied until she had written to Taylor. Taylor answered her letter and the two continued a correspondence which grew with each month until finally Taylor of the movies came back to New York to try to make some amends for his conduct as Deane-Tanner, the negligent father. Taylor never explained why he had changed his name. But Mrs. Robins said he met her and the daughter on at least one occasion and expressed a desire to try to make good for his failure. He spent money lavishly on the girl, giving money and other presents to her and encouraging her to study. The love of the beautiful in art that appears to have impressed his Hollywood friends cropped up in his talks with his daughter, and he ultimately prevailed upon her to enter an art school in this city. She is now studying there. Mrs. Robins emphatically denied that her former husband ever married after he deserted her. She said she met him last August and remembers distinctly that he said he never had remarried and never would. His daughter, she quoted him as saying, was the only pal he wanted. According to Mrs. Robins, Deane-Tanner was of a family well known in Ireland--listed among the landed gentry or the peers, she wasn't sure which. His father was a Major in the British army, and he came of a line of men whose names have figured in British history. She said he was prepared for the army at one of the great British universities--Oxford or Cambridge--and that he was about to start for the military school when his health failed. He was sent to the United States, he told her, so that he might recover. Mrs. Robins said she remembers that he told her once he had two sisters and one brother, and she met soon after their marriage a man she supposes was the brother. The stories of drugs and drinking, Mrs. Robins thinks, are untrue, because while Deane-Tanner was her husband he used liquor but sparingly and always criticized those who did not know how to handle it. Before her marriage to Taylor--or Deane-Tanner, as he called himself then--Mrs. Robins was Miss Ethel May Harrison. No one could be found who could explain fully Deane-Tanner's early movements in New York, but it was established that he came from Ireland with considerable money and a habit of spending it freely. He caused some attention in sporting circles, talked about his yachts abroad, and eventually, it was said, became a familiar figure on the float of the Larchmont Yacht Club. He made friends easily and held them. Suddenly he began talking of previous visits here, and it was said yesterday, by men who knew him but do not want their names coupled with his in the murder mystery, that he let it be known he had played in roles opposite Fanny Davenport. Mrs. Robins would not say where she and her first husband made their home or where they were living when he disappeared, but it was established through friends that he dropped out of sight in 1908 a few weeks after the Vanderbilt cup races.

SLAIN MOVIE MAN HAD CAREER HERE; DESERTED HIS WIFE Taylor Is Revealed as W. C. Deane-Tanner, who Disappeared in 1908. WIFE IS NOW MRS. ROBINS She and Daughter Later Recognized Him in Film and Met Him on His Way to Europe. BROTHER ALSO LEFT FAMILY Los Angeles Inquest Results In Formal Verdict Without Hearing All Actresses Called. The murder of William Desmond Taylor in Hollywood, which was found yesterday by a Coroner's jury at Los Angeles to be the work of an unknown assassin, has served to bring to light the past life of himself and his brother in New York, where they were known under their rightful name of Deane-Tanner, and to reveal curious coincidences in the lives of both men. Both apparently abandoned their wives and children and vanished, the elder to turn up as Taylor, the moving picture director of unusual ability, and the younger to remain a mystery. Taylor was William Cunningham Deane-Tanner, a member of a good family of Dublin, Ireland. He married Miss Ethel May Harrison, a member of the original Florodora company, whose right name was Hamilton. She was the daughter of a broker. Taylor abandoned her in 1908, and in 1914 she got a divorce and married Edward L. C. Robins, Treasurer of the S. M. Robins Company, which conducts a number of restaurants in the financial district and owns Delmonico's restaurant. When Mrs. Robins heard yesterday that bits of her former husband's past life in New York were becoming known, and that her marriage to him was known, she issued a statement in which she definitely established that Taylor, the murdered moving picture man, and Deane-Tanner, the former dealer in English antiques on Fifth Avenue, were the same person. "I married in December, 1901, Mr. William Cunningham Deane-Tanner of Dublin, Ireland," said Mrs. Robins. "He disappeared in October 1908. We could assign no reason for his disappearance except possible aphasia. In 1912 I got a decree of divorce in the State of New York, and was awarded the custody of my only child, Ethel Daisy Deane-Tanner, now 19, in August 1914, I married Edward L. C. Robins. "Two and a half years ago I discovered that William Desmond Taylor had been Mr. Deane-Tanner. I have no further statement which possibly could be of interest. The news of Mr. DeaneTanner's death was a great shock to my daughter and me." Wife Absolves Him of Blame. Mrs. Robins was seen later at her home in Mamaroneck, a cottage about two miles south of the station, and talked more freely about her first husband, whom she absolved of all blame in leaving her because she thought he was mentally upset at the time. She also revealed that she had met him in New York for a few moments before he sailed for Europe about a year ago, and that her daughter had been in constant correspondence with him. Mrs. Robins is an attractive woman. She was dressed in a dark blue silk frock and wore a golden ornament on a black silk cord about her neck. She is a woman of charm and courtesy, terms which she applied to Deane-Tanner in describing him. The exact reason for Deane-Tanner leaving his home has always been a mystery to her, and she never asked him about it after her daughter began to write to him or when she saw him at the pier. "It was just like a man pickup his hat to leave the house," was the way she put it. He left all his clothes, his money, and sufficient means to provide for her. He had occasionally suffered severely from neuralgia and she thought this had affected his mind. He once told his daughter that he had had a lapse of memory for a year after he left New York. The way in which Mrs. Robins learned that her first husband was not dead was dramatic. She and her daughter were at a moving picture theatre on3 day two and a half years ago when suddenly Deane-Tanne appeared on the sereen as one to of the principal characters in the play. She recognized him immediately, although he was without the mustache which he had worn when she was married to him. "That is your father," she exclaimed to her daughter, and her daughter then recognized him also from a photograph she had seen. They saw that he was using the name William Desmond Taylor and the daughter wrote to him in care of the moving picture company in whose productions he was appearing. He answered his daughter's letter, and they kept up a regular correspondence. He once came to New York, she said, and met his daughter. They had a long talk together. He was delighted to see her as she was to see him. He told his daughter then that he was not remarried, and Mrs. Robins says she is sure from what he said that he was telling the truth. He intimated that he would leave his property to his daughter in his will, Mrs. Robins said. Deane-Tanner was of a fine old Irish family, Mrs. Robins said, the son of a Major in the British Army. He was a member of the British Public Schools association, which comprises alumni from the famous public schools of Eton and Harrow and was also an English university man. He had two brothers and two sisters, but Mrs. Robins knew only the one brother. Mrs. Robins said that she got her diorce on statutory grounds in New York, but that she did not name a corespondent. She said that she had no complaint to make of him, and that she could not imagine how any one could have had sufficient cause to kill him. In his dealings with others he was always considerate, she said, and every one liked him. The daughter is now attending an art school in New York, but Mrs. Robins could not say which one because she does not want her daughter brought into the case. She was asked if she could go to California, and said that would all depend on circumstances. Brother 's Record Uncovered. The murder of Taylor which led to the discovery of his first marriage and his abandonment of his wife, a chapter which Mrs. Robins had hoped was forgotten, also curiously enough resulted in uncovering the past history of his brother Dennis Deane-Tanner, who also married in New York and left his wife when she was recovering from a severe illness in the Adirondacks, and his two children. Both men had been connected with antique shops and both had vanished so completely that their New York friends never again came in contact with them. The picture of Taylor as a man austere and scholarly, who paid little attention to women, as drawn by some of his moving-picture associates. was also shattered, for there are persons in the city who, while admitting that both the Deane-Tanners had been men of culture and pleasing personalities, said that their affairs with women had been such that no one who knew them could help noticing them. Just when the Deane-Tanners came to this country was not definitely estabished yesterday but it is believed that William, the elder brother, came here originally about thirty years ago while very young and went to Runnymede, a settlement near Harper, Kan., estabisied by Ned Turnley in 1887 or 1888 for emittance men-the impecunious sons of English society. There was a young man named Tanner in the colony for a short time, and old residents of Harper said yesterday that they remembered him, and that he left the colony in a short time and went back to England or Ireland. He later returned to this country but did not go back to Runnymede. The next heard of Tanner was when he married Miss Harrison in 1901, and when he later became Vice President of the English Antique Shop, conducted by A. J. Crawford, at 240 or 246 Fifth Avenue, between Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth Streets. His wife was known as a very accomplished woman, who had been well educated by her father when he was well to do and was a planist of some ability. Deane-Tanner was handsome and gallant, popular with all who knew him. He was active in the affairs of the Larchmont Yacht Club between 1904 and 1908, when he disappeared, and was a member of the Art Committee. Drank Heavily Before Disappearance. He began to drink quite heavily shorty before his disappearance, and it was thought by those who knew him that he was unhappy. A few days before he disappeared he went to the Vanderbilt Cup race on Long Island and it was said yesterday by his associates of those days than he started on a "spree" that wound up in the old Continental Hotel, which in those days was on Broadwav at Nineteenth Street. He sent to his office for $600 to be sent to him quickly. It was delivered to him at the hotel and he was never seen again in New York. A few years of Deane-Tanner's life drop out of the story here, and he next turned up on the Pacific Coast. He is supposed to have wandered up to Alaska, where he became ill in Nome, and later to have found his way back to San Francisco. He was down and out then, a wreck of the former handsome man who sold women expensive antiques and played around the yacht club. He had been friendly in New York with the husband of Eleanor Gordon, an actress, and they found him one day in San Francisco, where he was just out of hospital. They sent him to Los Angeles to get his health back, supplied him with money, and when he was well again got him work with a moving picture company. He acted a little, became a director, and after that his success was rapid. For two years during the war he was an officer in the Canadian Army. When he was shot he was in the position of having his productions featured under his name in stead of that of the star who played in them. Dennis Deane-Tanner was much the same type of man. He was younger and had served in the British Army as Lieutenant during the Boer war. He came to New York after his brother had married, and also went into the antique business, being associated with A. S. Vernay on East Forty-fifth Street. He was manager there and was looked upon as the counterpart in courtesy and culture of his brother. He married Miss Ada Brennan in 1907, and had two children, and at the time he disappeared lived at 247 West 101th Street. He was a vigorous, athletic man and was a member of the New York Athletic Club. Dennis Deane-Tanner 's wife became ill, and went to the Adirondacks to recover, leaving her children with her husand and her mother. Vernay returned from Europe the day before Dennis disappeared, and his manager met him and went with him to the shop to discuss business. That was the last Mr. Vernay saw of him. The next morning Dennis kissed his children and left the house in good spirits. He never retumed. Search for Dennis in Vain. Mrs. Deane-Tanner came back from the mountains and with the help of the police conducted a long search for her husband without success. So did an insurance company which had insured his life. His accounts were in good shape, and there was nothing to account for his disappearance, unless it was that he craved more freedom to follow his own desires. From time to time rumors came back to the Vernay shop that Dennis had changed his name and gone into the moving picture business. What started these rumors nobody knew yesterday, they were the more remarkable because until Taylor was killed none of his New York associates knew that the moving picture man was the man who had left the City in 1908. There was some speculation yesterday as to whether Taylor had sent for his brother and persuaded him to alter his life, as he himself had done. If Dennis did go into moving pictures, he changed his name so completely that a search of books on the moving picture industry failed to reveal a man who would suggest the former New Yorker. The possibility that Dennis DeaneTanner did actually drop out of life more completely than his brother is suggested by the later connection between William and his brother's wife. She went to Monrovia, Cal., where she has relatives, and has been living at 426 Lennon or Lemon Avenue. A search of the dead man 's papers showed that he had been giving her a monthly allowance, which would indicate that he was as ignorant as she of his brother's whereabouts; or, it was suggested, he may have been acting as his brother's agent in transferring to her money for her support.

...Miss Minter was not at the inquest, which was held this morning; but she was represented by counsel. She had known the dead man well. She was hysterical when she learned of his death. 'It was terrible,' she said. 'I rushed at once to my mirror and looked at my face. I was appalled. I kept the expression and hurried to mamma. ''Mamma,' I cried, 'did you ever see this expression on my face before.' ''No,' she said; 'it is perfect. Frozen horror! You've never done it before.''...

--Henry Peavey, negro, who described himself as 'Mr. Taylor's valet,' was a conspicuous figure at the inquest over the body of his former master here this morning. Dressed in a natty check suit, Peavey arrived early and was the center of several groups of curiosity seekers. Just before the inquest began he asked permission to see the body. He was led to the room where the body of the famous film director lay. Peavey approached the body and then broke down. He cried for more than a minute. Then he walked around the corpse several times. 'He looks just like he did many times when I would go to wake him up in the morning to give him his medicine--just so natural,' he said, tears streaming down his face. A few minutes later Peavey took his seat in the inquest room, having mastered his emotions.

Practically the only new developsent in the inquest testimony was that the bullet which ended Taylor 's he ranged upward after entering the body on the rear of the left side about ? inches above the hip and lodged near the shoulder.
