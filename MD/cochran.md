             STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT
               ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Part 3] 

             DORAN: I understand the night of the murrder you were with Mr Neilan. 

            MINTER: No, I was not. I was at home with my grandmother and sister. 

             DORAN: I mean after the murder, after you learned of the murder.

             MINTER: Yes, Friday. 

             DORAN: The next night, was it?

             MINTER: No, it was the night after Thursday. Mr Neilan -- I mean Mr Taylor was found
               dead Thursday morning, was he not? 

             DORAN: Yes.

             MINTER: Thursday was such a long day. Friday night I saw Mr. Neilan.

             DORAN: Did he. communicate w1 th you or you with him? 

             MINTER: Why, he communicated with me; he tried to, but it was because of me he did
               that. On Thuraday night I was worried about Mr Taylor; I was worried about Mr Neilan
               and called Marshall's mother.

             DORAN: This was after the murder?

             A Yes, this vas Thursday night after the murder. I said, "Please tell Mickey not to
               drive that green car so reckless; I am so afraid that he, too, will fall into
               trouble. And she thanked me and said, "I will tell him. That is just exactly what I
               havebeen thinking lately myself, and I want to see you soon, Mary." With that I
               thought no more about it. In fact, I didn't even think [page 14] Marshall would call
               me. He had not caled me in three week or more. 1 thought no more about it and I was
               surprised the next day to learn -- yes, Friday -- that he had tried to get me at
               five-thirty. My sister was at our old home where there is a telephone. The present
               home has no telephone, and when he happened to call there she was there.

             DORAN: At five-thirty of what day? 

             MINTER: Friday; and he ea1d he ms very anxious to see me. She knew I had left and
               wass driving with George Scarborough, and she said she didn't know what time 1 would
               be back. He said well, he wanted me to come to see him before ten o'clock, but after
               ten o'clock he would be on location. He didn't say the Salt Lake Station, but he was
               very anxious to get hold of me before ten o'clock. I came in after ten and they all
               told me l had better call Marshall; he seemed very anxious to get hold of me. I
               didn't· know where to call him; I thought possibly he would come to the house. I
               I were you I would call him up or at 1east call his mother and find out where he is."
               I called the studio and the night watchman immediately said, "Mr Neilan is not here;
               is this Miss Minter?" I said, "Yes."

             And he said, " Mr Neilan ia at the Salt Lake Station." Mr Scarborough and l drove
               down there in my runabout. He was very hard at work and had been all night, it seemed
               he had [page 15] been working all night for four nights past. They were all just dead
               tired. Night and day they had been working. He finished about two-thirty, and then
               there were several in the party, Gloria Swanson, Jack Pickford, Frank Urson -- Mr
               Frank Urson is now associated with Mr Neilan as director -- and Marshall and myself.
               We went to his mother's home where he lives with his mother and we tried to make eggs
               and things. It was very amusing; we only had four eggs, and I tried to fry two of
               them and ruined the things, adn we didn't have enough to go around and we made so
               much noise his mother, who was ill upstairs, told us we must behave ourselves.
               Marshall said, "There is only one thing to do; I have got to talk to you. We have had
               all of this foolishness, and I have got something very important to say to you, Mary.
               Let's drive to the studio where we can talk." We drove down to the Hollywood studio
               and we sat there in the office, the lights burning and the watchman was there and the
               property man was not around. He was outside. We talked until dawn; it was dawn when
               we came out of the place.

             DORAN: What were you talking about?

             MINTER: About Mr Taylor and letters Marshall Neilan had tried to get for me.

             DORAN: Who had tried to get for you?

             MINTER: Marshall had tried to get for me, which was the first inkling I knew of his
               knowledge of my letters, that I had written any to Mr Taylor. He told me certain
               very, very [page 16]ghastly things have since been proven absolutely true. He told
               them to me in my interest, but they made me very furious at the time, and we left
               more or less in a quarrel.

             DORAN: Will you please tell us everything that he told you there?

             MINTER: Yes, indeed. He first said, "Mary, sit down. I have something very importnat
               to tell you." I sat down, and he said, "You know this murder of Bill is going to be
               the greatest nine-days wonder" or "nineteen-days wonder that we have ever had,
               certainly that Los Angeles ever had. You don't know what a terrible thing it is going
               to be." I said, "Yes, I do. It is awful!" He said, "Now, Mary, I tried to get your
               letters" --

             DORAN: May I interrupt you a moment? What time did you arrive at his studio?

             MINTER: We left location, he worked down at the Salt Lake Station, about two-thirty
               to a quarter to three, we left there and went to his house. How long we were there I
               couldn't say; I didn't have a watch; I imagine we were there about an hour or maybe
               more, and then we went on down to the studio and we stayed until dawn, whatever time
               that is. We then came on back to my house. Mother was waiting for us and we got out
               and explained to her. Mother knew he had had a verious talk and she felt sure
               Marhsall would try to come to our aid. My mother is very fond of Mr Neilan and the
               whole family. He said he was just dead tired. The man took his hours when hee needed
               sleep to tell me these things. He was going to be up at eight o'clock that morning
               and he didn't even go to bed that night. He just sat up in his clothes and went out
               to work again at eight o'clock. Anyway, he said, "I tried to get your letters for
               you. You know they are a very important factor in the case, if they get hold of
               them." I was shocked to find that he knew of my letters. I said that I wrote some,
               and he said something about going to a newspaper or getting hold of some body in
               Pasadena to get me the letters. That part is not clear in my mind. I think I was so
               tired at the time I couldn't understand him. I haven't seen him since or I would have
               questioned him again about the letters just what he did. He told me I should have
               received them that day. He asked me if I had gotten them and I said, "No, I haven't
               received the letters today." He said, "Well, I sent them to the studio, and I believe
               the studio," the Realart Studio where I had last worked. He said, "They are in
               Charley Eyton's hands now." He either said Charley Eyton or Mr Carbut, but I can't
               state this acutally because I was so tired at the time I could hardly hear him and I
               was desperately interested to hear what he said about the letter, and I strained all
               my nerves to hear, but instead it came back and forth; it was hazy. I don't know the
               exact words he spoke. Anyway, I remember saying, "Well, there is nothing in the
               letters that the world can't read except that it is horribly painful to me to have
               them read my letters to him." He said, "You loved Billie, didn't you?" I said, "Yes,
               Marshall, I loved him deeply and sincerely." And he said, "Did you ever want to marry
               him?" Whereupon I replied, I said, "No, no; I know it couldn't have been. It was not
               meant to be." Then we talked about -- Oh, yes. Then he said, "Now, Mary, I am going
               to tell you some very important thing; they are going to hurt you, going to shock
               you, but before I say a word I want you to consider Billie was just as crazy as a
               March hare months before his death." He said, "I am going to recite a few instances
               that Bill told me about, things irrelevant to you, to show he didn't do this only to
               you but to others of his very best friends." 

             Marshall and Mr Taylor were extremely good friends. I don't think they saw each
               other often, but they were most affectionately fond of each other. He said, "On
               several occasions Bill" -- he spoke of him as 'Bill' -- "has confessed to me that --
               Oh, I am so tired I can't think how I am trying­ to say it. He came up to my room in
               the club one day and he said, "Oh, I know something about you, Marshall, and those
               gold-tipped cigarettes I found of yours." Whereupon Marshall said he replied, "Well,
               you needn't say anything, Bill" -- l don't know what it was, a cigar or something of
               some personal nature that he recognized of Mr Taylor's at somebody's house. I don't
               know whose house. He said, "That makes us Elks. Don't you say anything about me, what
               I have been doing in a joking, friendly manner." Mr Taylor, he said, suddenly stood
               up and looked at him very seriously, soberly, and said, "Marshall, I am surprised at
               the things you are doing now-a-days." Marshall said, "Just what do you mean by that?"
               and he said, "Why, what you said to your wife the other night at Sunset Inn about
               poor little Gloria Swanson."

             I may be getting some of those words mixed; maybe he didn't say "poor little Gloria
               Swanson." Maybe Marshall didn't tell me that. This is my impression. Marshall said,
               "What do you mean?" And he said, "Don't you remember the night we were at Sunset Inn
               and you were sitting here and Miss Swanson was sitting there and your former wife,
               Gertrude Banbrick, came in and said, 'Hello, Gloria, how are you?' and Gloria replied
               pleasantly, and you turned to Gertrude Bambrick and said, 'How dare you speak to this
               girl?' pointing to Gloria, the lady he was with, 'How dare you speak to her? Don't
               you ever dare to speak to her again,'" And Mr Taylor was telling Marshall Neilan.
               Marshall said he looked at him and said, "What's the matter with you, Bill? Are you
               drunk?" He said, I haven't had a drink," Mr Taylor said, and he said, "The funny part
               of it was he wasn't drunk." He couldn't detect it on his breath. "But he looked quite
               as serious and sober as I do this minute." He said, "Why, tell me what day you think
               this was." He said it was on a certain day -- I don't know if Marshall told me the
               day or not. He said, on a certain day at Sunset Inn recently. Marshall said, "Why,
               Bill, at that time l I was in New York City and was not in Los Angeles nor
               California."

             Mr Taylor and he had quite a friendly argument over it, and he said, "I know it is
               so; I was there myself and heard what you said upon this greeting between those two
               girls." Marshall said he thought perhaps he had lost his mind. The next day he called
               up, haVing that in mind, Miss Swanson and he said, "Gloria, am I going crazy? Have I
               lost my mind? Do you remember of ever being at Sunset Inn with me when Gertrude
                  Bambrick passed our table and spoke to us pleasantly and railed at my former wife for
               having spoken to you pleasantly and told her not to speak to you again?" And she
               said, "What on earth are you talking about? What is this? I don't understand you,"
               And he said, "Do you ever remember seeing Bill Taylor there near us at any time on
               any such occasion?" And she said, "Certainly not, !the oniy time I ever saw William
                  Taylor at Sunset Inn was the night I was with" -- I don't know his name, some friend
               of hers -- "and Bill Taylor was sitting away over on the other side by the wall and
               we were by the orchestra on this side." He said, "Was I there?" And she said, "No.
               Don't you remember you were in New York at the time?" He said, "That is one instance,
               Mary, of Bill's failing mind, I have never cleared that up. Bill and I have discussed
               it many times since, and I have always gone away puzzled, amazed, that he still stuck
               to his version of my having spoken to my former wife as I did. I didn't see her;
               neither Miss Swanson saw her on that occasion." Then he said, "On another occasion
               Bill told me he had received a letter from Blanche Sweet; that she told Mr Taylor
               that she was grieved he was sick;" that Marshell Neilan was calling on me and she
               intended to sue him. Marshall said that sounded so unlike Miss Sweet that he went to
               her and questioned her, and he said, "Blanche, have you writtn to Bill lately?" She
               said, "Why, yes, I wrote him a little note not so long ago thanking him for some
               poinsettias he sent me Christmas." He aa1d, "Did you say anything else?" She said,
               "No, not that I can remember." He said, "Did you ever say that you regretted my going
               about with Miss Minter and that you intended to sue me?" She said, "Perfectly
               ridiculous. What do you mean? I certainly did not say any such thing."

             Marshall at that time said to me, "And you know Blanche doesn't lie. She certainly
               doesn't lie; tbat is her reputation all over the world, over the picture game. I have
               heard that hundreds of times myself; I am pretty sure it is so." He said, "Now, that
               is another instance of poor Bill's insanity. Now, Mary, here is the ghastly thing I
               have to tell you." He said, "One time" -- I don't know whether he said in his room or
               the club, he was somewhere, I think in one of his own rooms, he, Marshall Nieilan,
               and Arthur Hoyt, Cap Robinson -- He said "Cap Robinson"; maybe he meant "Captain"; I
               don't know; I don't know how he is; I know Arthur well. He said, "We were all
               standing around there talking pleasantly" -- I think he said Antonio Moreno was
               there. He said, "We were all talking pleasantly and Mr Taylor suddenly started
               talking about you, and the talk grew finally more and more personal and finally he
               said -- and this is terrible -- 'presently he said you had been over in the last two
               weeks" -- I should say this is within at least three weeks of Mr Taylor's death; I
               think Marshall told me at the time, but I have forgotten the time. -- "within the
               last two weeks, that you were undressed in his apartments; that you beseeched him for
               his love; that he resisted you, and finally persuaded you to leave his
               apartments."
