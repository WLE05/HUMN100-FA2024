            T.H. Ziegler, being first duly sworn, testified as follows:

            BY THE CORONER:

            NANCE: Please state your name.

            ZIEGLER: T.H. Ziegler.

            NANCE: Where do you live?

            ZIEGLER: 425 North Hill.

            NANCE: What is your occupation?

            ZIEGLER: Police officer.

            NANCE: Mr. Ziegler, were you called to the
                  premises when the deceased was found dead?

            ZIEGLER: I was.

            NANCE: When did you arrive there?

            ZIEGLER: A little before
               8 o'clock in the morning of February 2nd.

            NANCE: Will you state what you found when you got there?

            ZIEGLER: I found the deceased, Mr. Taylor, lying just inside of the door, on
                  his
               back. His
               hands, one of them, apparently to the side
               of his
               body, and the other lying outstretched; and
                  blood pouring from his
               mouth. He
               was lying with his
               head to the east, flat on his
               back, dead. 
            NANCE: Was his
               body rigid and cold?

            ZIEGLER: It was.

            NANCE: Indicating he had been dead for some
                  time?

            ZIEGLER: Yes, sir.

            NANCE: Did you see any evidence of a disturbance
               in the house?

            ZIEGLER: Not any.

            NANCE: Who was there when you arrived there?

            ZIEGLER: The owner of the building; Mr.
                  MacLean; another movie actor
                  [Charles Maigne], and Peavey.

            NANCE: You mean the owner of the building, Mr.
                  Jessurun?

            ZIEGLER: Yes, sir, and Mr. MacLean and another man I don't know.

            NANCE: One of the adjacent
               tenants of the building?

             ZIEGLER: Yes sir, living next door
               east of Mr.
                  Taylor.

            NANCE: Did you question any of those persons as to whether they had heard any gunshot the
                  night previous?

            ZIEGLER: I did. I learned that from Mrs.
                  MacLean, that along about fifteen or perhaps ten minutes to
                  eight,
               the night before, she heard
                  a shot. She thought it was a gunshot. She went to her
               front door and opened the door, and saw a man standing in Mr. Taylor's
               door. She looked at him, and he stood and looked at her; and he walked down the
                  steps, turned to the left, and going
               around the end of the building, which is to
               the east; and out into the street. 
            NANCE: Into what street?

            ZIEGLER: Which is  Maryland, I think.

            NANCE: Did Mr. Jessurun tell you he heard a shot?

            ZIEGLER: I think he did.

            NANCE: Did he say why he didn't try to investigate it?

            ZIEGLER: He did not. He didn't know but what it was an automobile making a noise.

            NANCE: Did Mr. MacLean endeavor to investigate
               it?

            ZIEGLER: Not that I know of, and Mrs. MacLean's maid
               also heard a shot.

            NANCE: Did they say why they didn't attempt
               to investigate the cause of the shot?

            ZIEGLER: They did not.

            NANCE: Did you find any weapon about
                  theroom where the deceased was lying?

            ZIEGLER: I found a  weapon in the room above.

            NANCE: Where was it?

            ZIEGLER: In the front bedroom in the dresser drawer, lying on a sort of box.

            NANCE: Did you investigate to see whether the
                  clothing was powder
                  burnt or not?

            ZIEGLER: I did not. That was investigated,
               I understand, later.

            NANCE: Did you ask any of the persons who were called by
                  Henry Peavey, the valet, whether there was any
                  weapon there when they first came into the
                  room?

            ZIEGLER: Yes, sir. We looked for everything of that
               kind.

            NANCE: Have you formed any conclusion whether it
               was possible this shot could have been fired by
               the deceased
               himself?
            ZIEGLER: Impossible.

            THE CORONER: Have you any questions, gentlemen?

            NANCE: By a juror: Was the revolver found upstairs
               loaded? 

            ZIEGLER: It was. It had five shells in it; it had
               not been shot of late. 

            NANCE: Was it the same caliber bullet as was
               found on the deceased?

            ZIEGLER: This was a .32 automatic Savage.

            NANCE: In the drawer
               upstairs?

            ZIEGLER: Yes.

            NANCE: What was the number of the bullet that was
               found? 

            ZIEGLER: I understand that it was a .38. I
               haven't seen it.

            THE CORONER: That is all, you may be excused. That is all the evidence we will take in this case. All but the
                  Jury will be excused. 
            I hereby certify that I, as a shorthand reporter,
               correctly took down in shorthand the testimony and proceedings had at the within named
                  Coroner's
               inquest; that the foregoing is a full, true and
               correct copy of my shorthand
               notes and a full, true and correct statement
               of the testimony and proceedings had at said
                  inquest. E.M.
                  Allen, Shorthand Reporter

            DETECTIVE STATEMENTS

            MR. CAHILL: We tested that and the bullet --- the gun was
               not more than an inch away from his body and they
               couldn't possibly get that close. 
            MR. WOOLWINE: I heard it was 2 to 4 inches.

            MR. CAHILL: No, we have got it to within an inch, the test shows that.

            MR. WINN: In my opinion, the shot that was fired
               4 inches from the pants in making
                  that demonstration, is the nearest likeness to
               the shot in the coat.
