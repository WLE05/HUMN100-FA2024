            STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
               OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Part 5]

            DORAN: This was the second time that he had
               declared love for you. On one occasion he proposed
               to you?

            MINTER: Yes.

            DORAN: He asked you to marry him?

            MINTER: Yes, and then he would dart away again. I
               mean he would call me up -- He can't call me up, because I have no telephone; he would send me flowers, too, and suddenly I would not hear from him for two or three weeks. As I said to
                  him in the car, not particularly about that but about other things, about
                  dinner engagements, about appointments, I said,
               "You know, Marshall, I never know when l am going
               to see you and when I am not going to see you, and just what you
               are going to do, and I am in no mood to go on like that at all; I don't care much
               about it."

            DORAN: When did you tell him that?

            MINTER: I told him that when we were driving the car.

            DORAN: How old a man is Marshall Neilan?

            MINTER: Just thirty.

            DORAN: Has he ever been married?

            MINTER: Yes, he has been married once for a
                  few days. He remained married to
                  his wife for a long time, for seven
                  years, I think, but he was actually only
               married a few days. I think he married when
                  he was twenty or nineteen.

            DORAN: Have you seen him since this Friday night?

            MINTER: No, I have not.

            DORAN: Have you talked with him over the
                  telephone?

            MINTER: It was really Saturday morning.

            DORAN: Has he called you up on the telephone?

            MINTER: No; he may have called me at the New Hampshire house and I wouldn't know.

            DORAN: You haven't talked with him over the telephone?

            MINTER: I haven't seen him or talked to him or come in touch with him in any way

            DORAN: You haven't received any letters from
                  him?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Did you part friendly or unfriendly?

            MINTER: We did part more or less friendly, as
               I always did with Marshall, no matter how angry I
               would become with him, somehow you can't bear
               malice against that boy.

            DORAN: You have become angry with him on other occasions?

            MINTER: Yes. This night for the time being, I was furious [missing page] [...]
                  Mr Neilan -- Taylor's, and at the time of Mr
                  Taylor's death, Harry was the assistant director in Mr Taylor's
               companies there, and he had said Harry had been in the
                  room looking over the effects -- Just a minute. I wonder if Charles Maigne told me this. I think Mr Neilan told me this, too, that Harry bad gotten the letters
               and taken them to Jim Vantrees, the camera man,
               whereupon I remarked, "I will bet Mrs Ivers had
               them," and I think he said, "Jim gave them to Mr Eyton," and that Mr
                  Eyton turned some of them over
               to the Examiner. I am so afraid l am telling
               things that are not so here, Mr Doran; I don't mean
               to, but I couldn't get all of it. That is as clear as I can make it. Anyway, I do
               remember this part, he said he heard about them, and I
               don't know how he heard about them, and that he
               went down, I believe, to the Examiner, to get
               ahold of them and he had something to do with Pasadena, a man, he did tell me the man's name.
               I don't remember his name, but I believe it be­gan with "S", and
               this man, Marshall said he was the big man
               over the entire Examiner force, told him to go down and take the letters. He said, "Of course, if
                  you breathe this it wi11 just about throw
                  me in jail for the rest of my life," but I don't believe it will. Then he said, "Didn't you get
                  them today?" I said, "I did not." As well as I remember, Marshall said, "I then sent them to the Realart Studio and
               they ought to be in Charley's hands now or
                  Mr Garbut." This whole Friday night
               is most hasy in my recollection.

            DORAN: This man knew before you were in love with Mr Taylor?

            MINTER: Oh, yes.

            DORAN: You had told him that, had you not?

            MINTER: No; in fact, I had never said to Marshall
                  "I am in love with William Desmond Taylor." I never had.

            DORAN: How did he find it out, then?

            MINTER: He knew about it, because we had been friends a long time. Before this
                  Marshall had come to my house very despondent and said, "I think I will go out in the garden
               and eat wooly worms." I said, "Don't feel that way; there are plenty of us who feel
               the same way." I am certain he knew about
                  this thing. I made no secret of
                  it, but I didn't promenade it
               about.

            DORAN: Don't you have a recollection of having told
                  him, Marshall
                  Neilan, that you were fond of Taylor?

            MINTER: No. Many times I said, "I admire Mr Taylor;
               I respect him; you know I respect his opinion; what a wonderful man I consider him to be."
                  He knew I regarded him most highly.

            DORAN: Do you remember if he asked you at the time
                  he
               pro­posed to you if you were in love with any one
               else?

            MINTER: No, he didn't ask me that at all.

            DORAN: Did you have any admirers who might have been jealous of him?

            MINTER: There was only one possible admirer, and
               that was Mr Dickson.

            DORAN: Any besides Mr Dickson?

            MINTER: No; in fact, if I may say so, neither Mr
                  Dickson nor Mr Neilan has been with
               me constantly enough, or I feel really care enough for me to do any such thing in my
               behalf, I mean such as commit murder. In my own
               mind I am absolutely convinced that I know they would not.

            DORAN: You think they are incapable, in other
               words?

            MINTER: I absolutely do.

            DORAN: What kind of cigarettes was Neilan smoking the night at the studio?

            MINTER: He smokes two kinds of cigarettes. He
               smokes a gold tipped called "Dimi"
               something from Egypt, I forget the name,
                  "D" something; I noticed it comes from Cairo; then he smokes Chesterfield cigarettes. At least, I have seen
                  him smoking Chesterfield cigarettes. I remember that much, because I have always
               admired the face of the Chesterfield
                  boy on that red back
                  sign, you know, that laughing
                  boy in the light hair that says, "Gee"! They satisfy!"

            DORAN: Did Neilan take you home then that morning from the studio or did you go
               back in your own car?

            MINTER: No; my car had been driven back to
               its garage by Mr
                  Neilan's chauffeur with my friend
               Mr Scarborough in it. Poor Mr Scarborough had been driving around with me
                  all evening. I hadn't been able to sleep and that was why I ws_ out.
                  He said if I didn't mind he would just go on back home, now that I was in safe
               hands, and get some sleep. He was pretty near
               dead tired. He isn't a very strong man.

            DORAN: So Neilan took you
               home then

            MINTER: Yes; right straight home.

            DORAN: Did he ask you to keep in confidence the
                  conversation
               you had had with him? Did
                  he tell you not to say anything about it?

            MINTER: l don't remember him saying to me, "You
               must keep this all in secret oonfidenoe"; no, I do not, because when we got home
               we discussed some of the things with mother, with
               the whole family, in fact; he discussed the
               seriousness of the conversation and told
               me not to do anything without my at­torneys.

            DORAN: He told you that?

            MINTER: Yes; he said, "You
               mustn't make any move without your attorneys."
                  He spoke of Mr
                  Mott and said Mr Mott was very able and
               that he would tell me the right thing to do and not
               to make a move without him.

            DORAN: Did you comment on his concern?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Did you say anything to him, for instance to this effect: "Why should you be so concerned about me? Why should I consult attorneys in connection with this
                  affair?" or anything like that?

            MINTER: No, I did not, because at the time, when I asked him if he suspected me of killing
               Mr Taylor, we had that out; he
               assured me he didn't suspect any such thing, but
                  he was very much impressed with the gravity of
               the situation. In fact, evidently he knew at that
               time exactly how these things were going to turn out. I mean that they would drag
               everybody's name into it; that the papers could
               get hold of for the notoriety of it. He said, "This
               involves picture people and you know how Hearst hates the picture
                  people. Hearst would do anything
                  he could if he
               thought you did know Mr Taylor," "There are lots of
               prominent people in the profession who knew him and loved him. They
               are certainly going to drag your name into it."

            DORAN: You didn't telephone
               Taylor on the night he was
                  murdered?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Where did you happen to be that night?

            MINTER: I was at home reading the Cruise of the
                  Kewa. It is a humorous
               book; it is really a travesty of Frederick
                  O'Brien's stories of the South Seas. It is very funny, and I laid
               there laughing all the evening. I was very -- right while I was laying
               on the couch reading aloud to mother and sister and we were all laughing heartily at
               that time, and at the same time Mr Taylor was
                  being murdered. It seems very horrible to
               me.

            DORAN: You had no company at home
               that night?

            MINTER: Let me see. I don't remember any. Possibly Mr
                  Stockdale, he generally did, or maybe somebody dropped in. I don't just
               remember. Usually every evening somebody drops in. I know they were not there at the
               time I was reading the book.

            DORAN: Your automobiles were all home?

            MINTER: Yes, unless I put my car in the
                  garage called the Standard Garage. I leave it there sometimes, the Standard Garage on Hollywood
                  Boulevard and Western Avenue. Sometimes when my girl friends stop with
               me and have her
               car, I would move out and put it in this
                  garage and maybe wouldn't call for it for
                  several days. I haven't been feeling well for some time; I have had
               bronchitis. I hadn't gotten well when this awful shock came to me, and I haven't used
               the little car very much.

            DORAN: Do you have a chauffeur?

            MINTER: Yes; faithful old Chauncy. Chauncy is just as concerned about this thing as my mother is.

            DORAN: Well, I don't think of anything else I care to inquire about now.

            MINTER: Mr Doran, if I can be of any possible help
               in any way, it is true I don't know any more than I have told you; if I can, please
               call on me the first thing, won't you?

            DORAN: Thank you, very much. You may think of little things of which you may not
               appreciate the imporance, Mr Mott.

            MINTER: As I told Mr Mott today, I remember saying to
                  Mr Mott, "I am so tired I am like a little child.
               I speak words mechanically. I sit, sleep, get up, walk and dress, and I don't see
               exactly what I am doing."
