            POLICE: Do you know of Sands securing a
               considerable amount of money that was not his? ** 

            POLICE: Did he say how he got the
               money?

            TIFFANY: Yes; I saw the
                  book, when he discovered the
                  book. 
            
               POLICE: Through checks? 
            
               TIFFANY: Through checks
               and money that he had left with him. 
            
               POLICE: Do you know of any women, frequent callers on Mr. Taylor? 
            
               TIFFANY: Yes; Mary Miles
                  Minter, Mabel Normand, Edna Purviance ** I think it was Mr.

               POLICE: Did you know Miss
                  Gerber? 
            
                TIFFANY: Yes, she has been there. 
            
                POLICE: Do you know if it was his (Taylor's) custom always to accompany a lady or escort her to the
               car? 
            
               TIFFANY: Yes, it was, he was very polite that way. 
            
               POLICE: Was it his habit to leave the door open when he would go
               out? 
            
               TIFFANY: If he stepped out the front door, it
               would generally be ajar. 
            
               POLICE: Do you believe that person (murdered) was familiar with
               the house, you know, the ground? 
            
               TIFFANY: They had been there; there seems to be no
               doubt about that. 
             POLICE: Somebody that knew the house? 
            
               TIFFANY: Yes. 
             POLICE: Did you ever know of any of those chauffeurs, say Fellows, or what is the
               other fellow's name? 
             TIFFANY: Harry Fellowand Howard Fellows or Bill Davis? 
             POLICE: Davis, yes. Did they ever handle any hop? 
             TIFFANY: No. 
             MR. WINN: This man Sands pried into Mr. Taylor's business more or less, did he not? 
             TIFFANY: Yes, he did in every way possible. 
             POLICE: He knew considerable about his affairs and Sands told you that Taylor's name
               was not Taylor, that his name was Deane-Tanner? 
             TIFFANY: Deane-Tanner. 
             POLICE: Did he tell you how he found that out? 
             TIFFANY: Well, through Taylor's correspondence, I presume. ** Taylor told me that
               Sands read every letter that came into the house for him. 
             POLICE: Did Taylor also tell you he didn't know how he found out so much, but he was
               trying to catch him? 
             TIFFANY: Yes. 
             POLICE: Did Sands ever tell you he had it on Taylor? 
             TIFFANY: For instance, Sands would say, "If the old man ever gets hard, or something
               of that sort, with me, I will let him know where I get off at, you see, and where he
               gets off," ** 
             POLICE: Do you know whether Sands had any means of finding out whether or not Taylor
               had slept with a woman in his home there or not? 
             TIFFANY: That Sands had any means? 
             POLICE: Yes. 
             TIFFANY: Absolutely. 
             POLICE: Tell us what it is. 
             TIFFANY: In finding the hair pins in the bed and these pink combinations had been
               used, and the douche bag had been used and Mr. Taylor had suppositories there at one
               time. 
             POLICE: Did Sands ever tell you what women he suspected of spending the night out at
               Mr. Taylor's home? 
             TIFFANY: Mary Miles Minter, Mabel Normand, and Miss Neva Gerber. 
             POLICE: Did he ever find any hair in the bed? 
             TIFFANY: Yes, and like this thing published in the paper, where it says "I love you,
               I love you," I seen that note at Taylor's house myself. 
             TIFFANY: (After telling how Mary had been told over the phone that Taylor wasn't
               home, that Mary would drive over to the house and catch Mr. Taylor there) She would
               be given to understand he wasn't there, and she would get in her car and come over,
               and find him there. I have seen her coming out of the house as if she were about
               ready to cry her eyes out. (M.M. Minter) 
             POLICE: On those occasions, how long had she remained in the house? 
             TIFFANY: Well, sometimes, well, he would be waiting there and I would go on home and
               he would come out and say he wouldn't need me anymore, to go on home ** The next
               morning I would take him to the studio and Jazz (Sands) would say "Let's go up and
               see who slept with the old man last night." 
             POLICE: Is it your wife that saw Sands on the street? 
             TIFFANY: Yes, that was 16th amp; Flower ** she told me about that the day before
               the murder. 
             POLICE: Did she tell you before she heard of the murder? 
             TIFFANY: Yes. 
             POLICE: That she saw Sands on the street? 
             TIFFANY: Yes, walking down 16th street. ** There was no question about it. 
             POLICE: She knew him? 
             TIFFANY: She knew him as well as she knew me. 
             POLICE: Just a moment. Did she have any conversation with him? 
             TIFFANY: No, not at that time. 
             POLICE: Did she speak to him? 
             TIFFANY: No; she said he turned and looked right at the street car, and looked right
               at her as if he didn't recognize her, and she said she had a notion to get off the
               car ** ** it just started, you know ** 
             POLICE: Did she say anything about his clothing being the same as it used to be, or
               different? 
             TIFFANY: She said he had on a cap, a grey cap and grey overcoat, one of these what
               you call them, a certain kind of coat. 
             POLICE: Gaberdine?  
             TIFFANY: Yes, that is it. 
             TIFFANY: She said he looked just as fat as he always did. He was an inch shorter
               than my wife. 
             POLICE: How tall? 
             TIFFANY: About 5 ft. 6 1/2 or 7 inches 
             POLICE: And his weight? 
             TIFFANY: About 187 pounds. 
             POLICE: Smooth shaven? 
             TIFFANY: Yes. 
             POLICE: Light complexion? 
             TIFFANY: Very ruddy complexion, healthy looking, very healthy. 
             POLICE: His hair? 
             TIFFANY: Well, his hair *** was blonde but his beard was dark. 
             POLICE: Did he wear glasses? 
             TIFFANY: No, not to my knowledge. **** Jazz wore about a 7 shoe. 
             POLICE: How about Sands' eyebrows coming together over his nose. Did they do that?
               ** 
             TIFFANY: Not quite. I remember one thing, they were a perfectly straight line, 
             POLICE: Not arched? 
             TIFFANY: No; they sort of came up favoring the upward turn more than any other way. 
             POLICE: What was his nationality? 
             TIFFANY: I think English, with a little Scotch. **** Without a doubt he had a
               wonderful education. 
             POLICE: Do you know whether Sands carried a gun or not? 
             TIFFANY: Yes, he did. 
             POLICE: What kind? 
             TIFFANY: He had a Colt's, whether that was his or Mr. Taylor's I don't know. **** I
               was down town with him several times, and he carried it with him once or twice to my
               knowledge, and he would stick it alongside the car and I would ask him what was the
               idea, and he just laughed about it, was all, but the man was a coward. ** 
             POLICE: Is he (Sands) hairy, is his breast hairy? 
             TIFFANY: Well yes to an extent, that is where it is long. 
             POLICE: He had long hair on his chest? 
             TIFFANY: Yes. 
             POLICE: And on his legs? 
             TIFFANY: Yes, extremely long, and he was ungodly.
