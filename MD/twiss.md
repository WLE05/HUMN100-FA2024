             Statements by Carl Stockdale June 10, 1937 LOS ANGELES NEWS

             It was divulged that Carl Stockdale, veteran
               character actor and close friend of Mrs. Charlotte
                  Shelby, mother of Mary Miles Minter,
               screen star who collapsed at news of Taylor's death, had
               admitted that he was in the company of Mrs. Shelby at the time
                  Taylor is believed to have been murdered.
                  Stockdale, interviewed at his home, 6325 Fountain
                  Avenue, chuckled when asked for his own conclusions on the long
               unsolved murder.

             "So Fitts thinks I killed William
                  Desmond Taylor," he remarked. "I'll tell you this, I was never in
                  Bill Taylor's home. I met him at a big party thrown by Mrs.
                  Shelby." Pressed for his own suspicions of the killer's
               identity, Stockdale promptly answered,
                  "Sands." He referred to Taylor's
               one-time chauffeur [sic], Edward Sands, whose
               mysterious disappearance immediately after the murder and before authorities could
               question him, has caused his name to be listed among those "wanted for questioning"
               by police. The veteran actor, now 63, declared he was with Mrs. Charlotte
                  Shelby at her home the night was murdered
               February 1, 1922. He fixed the time of his visit from 7 to 9
               p.m. Police have set the hour of the shooting at 7:45 p.m. "I told my brother,
                  Frank," Stockdale said, "that I was
               droppin' in on Mrs. Shelby that night." 
            
               Stockdale said he first met Mrs. Shelby in
                  Santa Barbara at the time when her daughter, Mary
                  Miles Minter was working for the old American Film Company. ---

            June 10, 1937 LOS ANGELES TIMES

             While authorities deferred definite action yesterday in the investigation into the
               fifteen-year-old murder of William Desmond Taylor, a 63-year-old
               film character actor stepped forward to make the most important statement to be added
               recently to the mazes of California's most famous murder
               mystery. The new figure in the case is Carl Stockdale, for years
               well known as an actor in Hollywood and who now lives at 6325 Fountain
                  Avenue. 
            Disclosing that he had been a close friend of Mrs. Charlotte
                  Shelby, mother of Mary Miles Minter, the latter,
               who admitted she was in love with Taylor at the time of his
               slaying, Stockdale had this to say yesterday: "I have expected
               the authorities to question me for some time and have made no effort to evade such
               interrogation despite the fact that no one welcomes publicity of the sort. 
             "I was with Mrs. Shelby on the night that
                  Taylor was murdered at about the time fixed by the
               authorities that the fatal bullet was fired. That may be
               considered of importance to the authorities and is information I am quite willing to
               give." 
            Stockdale indicated that he is in complete sympathy with a
               statement recently issued by Mrs. Shelby in which she declared
               that, sick of the innuendoes which have followed in the wake of the
                  Taylor murder, she wanted action to clear up the case once
               and for all.

            Although apparently unwilling to move at once, the District Attorney's
                  office yesterday stated that Stockdale is scheduled to be questioned
               before the present investigation is concluded.

             "I am willing to tell all I know to the District Attorney or anyone else," commented
               the actor. "I have known Mrs. Shelby and her family for
               approximately twenty years. I was living on Winona Boulevard with my brother
                  Frank, and my mother and father on the day of the
                  shooting of Taylor. "In the evening I
               left my home and went to pay a visit to Mrs. Shelby in the new
               house she had purchased at Seventh street and New Hampshire
                  avenue. I arrived shortly before 7 o'clock in the evening and left
               about 9 o'clock."

            Taylor, as near as authorities could fix the time, was shot
               about 7:45 p.m. on February 1, 1922. Several persons in the neighborhood of his
               bungalow at 404-B South Alvarado street reported hearing a
               shot at that time. 
            "I was the first person," went on Stockdale, "to inform Mrs. Shelby that Taylor had
               been killed. That was about 9 o'clock the next morning. I had gone to the studio
               where I was working on a picture with Mabel Normand and some one told me that Taylor
               had been found dead. I telephoned Mrs. Shelby at once because I
               knew that he had been Mary's director and that the whole family
               knew him well."

             When a bullet snuffed out the life of William
                  Desmond Taylor, noted picture director, in 1922, Mrs.
                  Charlotte Shelby was at home. 
            
               Carl Stockdale, veteran actor and friend of Mrs.
                  Shelby, so testified in Superior Judge Parker
                  Wood's court yesterday.

             He appeared as a defense witness in trial of the civil suit by which Margaret Shelby Fillmore, Mrs.
                  Shelby's daughter, is seeking to regain $48,750 in bonds,
               which she contends her mother removed from a joint safety deposit box.

             "I was with Mrs. Shelby from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. in her apartment
               at Seventh street and New Hampshire avenue the night of the
               murder," Stockdale stated.
            
            "I did not know of the tragedy until the following morning when I arrived for work at
               the Mack Sennett Studios. 
            "I immediately called Mrs. Shelby and told her to prepare
               herself for a shock. Then I told her Mr. Taylor had been slain. 
             "She screamed: 'Impossible!' "

             The actor's testimony, while perhaps not strictly pertinent to the present
                  suit, was introduced to answer certain pointed intimations
               made during its trial, attorneys explained.

            
               Mary Miles Minter and the late Mabel
                  Normand frequently were mentioned in gossip concerning the
                  Taylor mystery, Stockdale said. But at
               no time had he heard rumors that Mrs. Shelby might be involved
               as a suspect, he added. 

             The actor also testified that he had seen Mrs. Fillmore under
               the influence of liquor four times between 1925 and 1931. 
             --- August 26, 1937 LOS ANGELES NEWS

            ...Stockdale's testimony was in the nature of a reply to that of
               Mrs. Fillmore two days ago when she said she did not know her
               mother's whereabouts at the hour of the murder. Cross-examined as to whether he had
               ever heard that Mrs. Shelby was a suspect in the murder, the
               veteran actor replied, "I did not hear any such rumors, but I did hear rumors that
                  Mary (Miss Minter) and Mabel Normand
               were suspected of the murder." ~~~~

             A. ** About 7:30 as near as I remember *** I was in my bath room

               and he hollered Mr. Taylor was dead, stone dead, somebody come quick. I ran back in the bathroom, grabbed
                  a towel, wiped the lather from my
                  face, put on a bath robe and ran
               over there. **** Well, when I went in Henry preceded me ** and

               he had died from a hemorrhage because blood had run from his mouth and his nose and
               then looked like from his ear and had congealed and he was
               lying perfectly natural as though he was simply laid out as a corpse. *** but the
               body was lying parallel with the desk with the feet to the
                  door and the rug, the corner of
               the rug near his foot was pushed
               back a little bit *** and the chair upright and this
                  foot under it and the chair at
               the desk wee pushed just partially under the
                  desk ** and the chair right
               between his head and the desk.
               Well, on the table was a check book
               open and two piles of checks. 
            Q. Has the rear door a spring lock
               or is it locked with a key.
             A. Locked with a key from the inside.

             Q. There was no chance for anybody at straightening this body out between the time
               the colored boy hollered and you went in there. 
             A. No, the only part of his body I touched was this arm and
               it was absolutely stiff.

            Q. How about his coat?

            A. It was as straight as if it had been pressed. ** and it was absolutely pulled
               perfectly straight.
