            PEAVEY: Henry Peavey.

            NANCE: Where do you live?

            PEAVEY: I live at 127 1/2 East 3rd Street. 

            NANCE: What is your occupation?

            PEAVEY: Cook and valet.

            NANCE: Mr. Peavey, were you employed by Mr.
                  Taylor, the deceased in this case? 

            PEAVEY: Sir?

            NANCE: Were you employed by the dead man in the case?

            PEAVEY: Yes,sir.

            NANCE: How long have you been working for him?

            PEAVEY: About six months.

            NANCE: Were you in the house on the evening when he
                  was found dead there?

            PEAVEY: Yes, sir.

            NANCE: What time did you leave the house?

            PEAVEY: I figured it was about a quarter past [seven] that I left the
                  house.

            NANCE: Where was he when you left?

            PEAVEY: He was sitting in a chair facing ust to the
               [illegible] now, and Miss Normand was sitting in a chair
               just the same. They were discussing a red-backed book.

            NANCE: In what part of the house were they?

            PEAVEY: They were near the dining-room, where you enter the
                  dining-room from the
               living-room.

            NANCE: That is a two-story apartment, is it not?

            PEAVEY: Yes, sir.

            NANCE: And on the ground floor, how many rooms?

            PEAVEY: The living-room, dining-room
               and kitchen.

            NANCE: Now, the entrance to this
                  apartment is immediately into the front there, is it
               not-the front room, rather?

            PEAVEY: The front room, yes sir.

            NANCE: They were seated?

            PEAVEY: Near the dining-room there, in the
                  living-room, near the entrance to the
                  dining-room. 

            NANCE: When you went out, which way did you go out, at the
                  front or the back?

            PEAVEY: I went out the front way. I always lock up the
                  back door when I go out. I always lock the
                  back door screen; it has a hook
               on the inside. I used the front door to come out all
                  the time.

            NANCE: Did you carry the back door key with you?

            PEAVEY: No, sir. I always turn it in the door and leave it
               just as it is.

            NANCE: Now, when did you next see Mr. Taylor?

            PEAVEY: The next morning, when I went to work.

            NANCE: What time are you in the habit of coming to work?

            PEAVEY: I am usually there about half past seven.

            NANCE: What time did you arrive there the next morning?

            PEAVEY: PEAVEY: just about half past seven.

            NANCE: What day was that?

            PEAVEY: Thursday morning [February 2].

            NANCE: On arriving there, what did you do?

            PEAVEY. I picked up the paper first; I stopped in a
                  drug store at the corner of 5th and Los Angeles
               to get a bottle of medicine - milk of
                  magnesia, he usually takes that every morning; I bought
                  that on my way out. I picked up the paper and unlocked the
                  door. The first thing I saw was his feet. I looked at his
                  feet a few minutes and said, "Mr. Taylor." He never moved. I
                  stepped a little further in the door, and seen his
                     face, and turned and ran out and
               hollered.

            NANCE: Who did you summon? Who did you call to?

             PEAVEY: I don't know.

            NANCE: You just made a lot of noise to attract all the attention you could?

            PEAVEY: Yes, sir.

            NANCE: Several people came, did they?

            PEAVEY: Yes, sir. I think Mr. Desmond [sic], and the
                  gentleman who owns the court was the
               first.

            NANCE: You mean Mr. Jessurun?

            PEAVEY: Yes, sir.

            NANCE: Who else came?

            PEAVEY: And Mr. - you see, I don't know their names - I just seen them - the two
               gentlemens next door, Mr. MacLean and Mr. - I can't
                  think of the other gentleman's name - right next door to us [Charles
               Maigne].

            NANCE: You didn't come back there after you had gone away, when Miss Normand was
               there with Mr. Taylor?

            PEAVEY: No, sir.

            NANCE: When you went out, was anybody around the place? 

            PEAVEY: Only Miss Normand's chauffeur; he had his lights all on inside the limousine,
               cleaning it. I hit him on the back and stopped and talked to him a few minutes.

            NANCE: When you first opened the door, did you see any furniture overturned, or any
               sign of a disturbance in the house?

            PEAVEY: Nothing more than a chair that was sitting next to the wall had been pushed
               out a little bit and his feet was under this chair. The rest of the furniture around
               the house and room upstairs was just as I left them when I went away that
               evening.

            NANCE: And did you notice whether anything had been taken off of his body, or not -
               any jewelry?

            PEAVEY: I didn't notice that; I didn't touch him at all.

             NANCE: Do you know whether he wore any valuable jewelry?

            PEAVEY: Yes sir, he had a wrist watch and another watch with a lot of little trinkets
               on; and a thing you stamp checks with to keep anybody from making the checks any big-
               ger, and a lead pencil.

            NANCE: Did he have a diamond ring?

            PEAVEY: Yes sir, he had a large diamond ring that he wore.

            NANCE: Do you know whether he had it on that evening?,

            PEAVEY: Yes sir, he was dressed just as when I went that evening, as I found him the
               next morning.

            NANCE: Was the ring on his finger the next morning?

            PEAVEY: Yes sir, his other jewelry that I had put away the night before was just as I
               had put it away up in the dresser drawer.

            NANCE: You didn't find anything taken from the apartment?

            PEAVEY: No sir, it was just as when I left it when I found it. The rug was a little
               bit kicked up. It looked like he had kicked it with his foot.

            NANCE: There was no other disturbance there?

            PEAVEY: No, sir. Even the living-room table that I had moved aside. The rocking chair
               would hit the table, and I moved the table so the rocking chair would not hit the
               table. It was just as I left it.

            NANCE: By a juror: Were any of the windows up at night?

            PEAVEY: No sir, we had those little long pins that runs in the windows. The windows
               upstairs in his bedroom were up. The windows downstairs I always locked with this peg
               that slipped in the window.

            NANCE: Were they still that way in the morning?

            PEAVEY: They were still that way in the morning. The lights were burning just as I
               had left them that night; two lights, one in the living-room and one in the
               dining-room.

            NANCE:That is all, you may be excused.
