            MRS. MARGARET SHELBY FILLMORE
             Sister of Mary Miles Minter
            Statement taken 3-10-26, at 10 AM.

            POLICE: You do have a recollection then that she was  (Mary)home
               at dinner that evening?

            FILLMORE: Oh, absolutely, because mama had cooked this dinner
               she particularly liked and hoped she would come home to it.

            POLICE: How long did she remain there?
             FILLMORE: After dinner we went into the living
                  room and Mary laid on the couch and read a book called
                  "The Cruise of the South Sea Islands". It was rather a
               dry book, but the way she read it was interesting and we simply sat around home and
               enjoyed our evening at home, the three of us. Now I know mother
               was not at home, because if she was, she would have been
               there, Mr. Fitts.

            POLICE: What time did you folks retire that evening?

            FILLMORE: We stayed up quite late, I guess mama retired about
                  10 or 11 o'clock. Mary and I stayed up and
               didn't do much of anything until about 12.

            POLICE: Well, you are quite positive that, after Mary came home that afternoon, she
               didn't go out again at all during the evening?

            FILLMORE: I am positive in this way; that we stayed up unti1 about 12
                  o'clock, until after mama went to bed and Mary's room is right next to mine
               and I didn't hear her go out. I am quite sure she didn't.

            POLICE: But you just said a few moments ago that she could come in without your
               knowing it.

            A Yes, she could have. ***

             POLICE: Then what time of the morning of the second of
                  February did your mother come back to the
               Hobart house?

            FILLMORE: Well, I should say around 9 or 10 o'clock.

            POLICE: When she came home to the Hobart house, she was acquainted with the fact that
                  Taylor had been killed?

            FILLMORE: She said that Margery Berger told her **

            FILLMORE: ** She (Mrs. Shelby) said, "Margery Berger tells me that Mr. Taylor has
               just been murdered."

            POLICE: You are, then, positive that your mother was not at the Hobart house that
                  night (night of murder)?

            FILLMORE: Yes, I am positive that she was at the New Hampshire
                  house.

            POLICE: And that she came in the next morning, early in the
                  morning?

            FILLMORE: Yes, she came after the call from Miss Berger.

            POLICE: Could it have been after 9 o'clock when she came in?

            FILLMORE: It could have been. As I say, it was early in the morning. I know it wasn't
               as late as 11.

             Q ** You knew nothing of Taylor's death until your mother
               told you about it?

            FILLMORE: No.

            ~~~~~

            CHARLOTTE WHITNEY
            Secretary to Mrs. Shelby
             Statement taken ll-28-25

             WHITNEY: ** and Mary stood up and looked at her mother and
               said, "Do you really mean that?"" and Mrs. Shelby said, "I certainly do." She accused
               her of being intimate with Taylor and then made other remarks. ** She locked herself
               in her mother's room ** and she got the gun and
                  tried to kill herself, but there was a safety catch on it
               and it wouldn't go off. ** Mary was monkeying with this thing and finally the catch
               released itself and the darn gun went off. **

            POLICE: What kind of a gun was that?

            WHITNEY: Revolver. A little snub-nosed thing.

            POLICE: Was it a black one?

            WHITNEY: Yes.

            POLICE: Who did the gun belong to?

            WHITNEY: Mrs. Shelby.

            POLICE: Do you know how long she had it?

            WHITNEY: Oh, she always carried a gun. I mean we always kept one in the
               house.

            POLICE: She knew how to handle a gun?

            A Oh, I should say so.

            A ** one night when we (witness and Mrs. Shelby) went down to Taylor's
               after Mary, Mrs. Shelby took the gun, but I don't think she had any intention of
               using it on Mary.

            POLICE: Did she (Shelby)
               threaten to kill
               him (Taylor)?

            WHITNEY: Yes. Several people heard that. It was in my
               office.

            POLICE: When was it in your office?

            WHITNEY: That was in 1920, in the summer. He
               (Taylor) had finished directing with Mary. Charley
                  Maigne was directing her and Charley was in the office, and Taylor was
               in the office. **

            WHITNEY: ** She said, "If I ever catch you hanging around
                  Mary again, I will blow your god damned
                  brains out." She walked right up to him. She was just
               livid with rage and shook her fist in his
                  face and swore dozens of times.


            POLICE: Do you know of an incident that occurred in which Monte
                  Blue was supposed to have been run out of the dressing
                  room with a gun by Mrs.
                  Shelby?

            WHITNEY: Well, I don't know that she had a gun, but I know
               that he was run out of the dressing room, because he ran into
                  my office from the dressing
               room.

            (Referring to incidents surrounding visit of Mrs. Shelby to Taylor's residence in
               search of Mary) ** She (Mrs. Shelby) said, "I will take my
                  gun, and if I find her there I am going to kill her." I
               begged her not to take it ** She wouldn't do it, so she went with the
                  gun. **

            POLICE: She had the gun with her at that time?

            WHITNEY: She had it in her hand and her coat
                  sleeve; she had big coat sleeves and the
                  gun was in her hand hid by her coat sleeve.

            POLICE: Do you know of any other trouble with Taylor that
                  Mrs. Shelby had?

            WHITNEY: They fought all the time. Always on the set when he
               was directing.

            POLICE: Was the situation getting worse a11 the time?

            WHITNEY: A11 the time. It was terrible.

            POLICE: Was there anyone else present at any of these battles,
               that you recall, over Mr. Taylor?

            WHITNEY: Well, Earl Stockdale. I am sure he was present.

            POLICE: Do you know any of her servants (Shelby's) at the time of the murder?

            WHITNEY: I knew them only by their first names. ** We had a butler named
                  Frederick, a butler named ¬≠Ernest, and
               a cook named Pauline. Edith Stewart was
               Mary's personal maid at that time

            POLICE: Can you think of any friends of yours, or any acquaintances of Shelby, in any
               way at all, that were associating with or closely associated with them immediately
               prior to, or immediately after, Taylor's murder?

            WHITNEY: M. George Periolet. is at Engstrom
                  Apartments, Los Angeles.

            POLICE: ** Have you talked to Jeanne McPherson at all?

             WHITNEY: Jeanne knows a great, big, large lot. Jeanne came over
               to see Mary a day or so after the murder. She would be a good person for
               you to talk to. And her mother, Mrs. O'Neil.

            POLICE: Well, going back to that old subject of the gun, I just wanted to be sure
               that Mrs. Shelby had it in the house for a long
                  time.

            WHITNEY: Oh yes, there was always a gun.

            POLICE: If anybody said that Mrs. She1by did not know anything about a pistol or
               revolver, and was afraid of one, that would not be true?

            WHITNEY: That's ridiculous. Mrs. Shelby was not afraid of anything.
