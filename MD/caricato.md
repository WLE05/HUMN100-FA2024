               Antonio Moreno Tells of Phone Conversation With Him
                     at 7 o'clock Night of Tragedy

            The assassination of William Desmond Taylor, Wednesday night,
               postponed forever an engagement which the film director had
               with Antonio Moreno, film star, on
                     Thursday morning. When Moreno talked with Taylor over the
                  telephone
               Wednesday night, about 7 o'clock, Taylor was in the best of spirits, according to Moreno's story told yesterday.
            But when the time came for the appointment to
               be fulfilled the following morning, between 10 and 10:30
                  o'clock, the film director's corpse lay in
               a local undertaking company's morgue, pierced by a
                  murderer's bullet. Moreno said yesterday that he had been an intimate friend
               of Taylor for several years, since the
               time Taylor had become associated with the old Vitagraph Company at Santa
                  Monica in 1914.
            "He was one of the finest men I ever met," "Tony"
               said. "He had the highest ideals, I believe, of any man I've ever met in the
               profession." Details of a dinner party which he attended with
                  Taylor, Miss Betty Francisco
               and Miss Claire Windsor, at the Ambassador Hotel
               Thursday night, January 27, were given by
                  Moreno, as well as an informal meeting
               held between Moreno, Taylor, Arthur Hoyt and a Captain Robinson [sic], January 28, at
                  Moreno's
               room at the Los Angeles Athletic Club.
            "I left them there about 7 o'clock," Moreno said, "to go to a dinner party at
                  the Ambassador, which I had arranged for
                  a friend visiting here from Chicago. Later, I understand, the three went to dinner at a roadhouse between
                  Los Angeles and Pasadena--I do not know its name--and then on to the
                  Annandale Club
               after dinner, finally going to Taylor's
               home."
            Moreno declared he had spent about two
                     hours last Monday with Taylor
               at the Vitagraph studio, where Moreno is working. He had an appointment with
               him for Tuesday, also, but the director, according to Moreno, did not fill it because of a
                  trip to Mount Lowe on location.
            "Then I called him again Wednesday night," Moreno said, "about 6 o'clock. His boy,
                  Henry, answered the
                  phone. Mr. Taylor was not
                  at home. However, he called me later, about 7,
               and we arranged that I should call for Mr. Taylor,
               at the Lasky studio, about 10 o'clock
                     Thursday morning. Mr. Hoyt was with me in
                  my room at the time. Mr. Taylor was to go with me to the Vitagraph studio, on a matter of personal business."
            "But--" and here Moreno gave a sorrowful shake of
               his head--"But you know the rest. The appointment was not fulfilled--and never will be. "I feel that in
                  Mr. Taylor's
               death I've lost one of the best friends I've
               ever know. And I'll do everything in my power to run down the man who killed him."

               LOS ANGELES TIMES Film Star Aids Police Search
                  Tony Moreno With Taylor
               Before Shooting
               Director Was Healthy and Cheerful, Says Friend Check on Events
               of Week Taken by Officers

            William D. Taylor appeared to be in the best of
               health and spirits about one hour before he was shot down in his own
                  apartment at 404-B South Alvarado Street. He did not appear to have any
               premonition of what lay in store for him, although, according to the police theory of the slaying of the film director,
               the murderer was then lurking in the shadows a few feet away
               from Mr. Taylor.
            This was disclosed yesterday by Tony Moreno,
                  Vitagraph star. Mr.
                  Moreno's story of his conversations with the slain director on the
               night of the murder and for a week prior to the shooting, furnish an
               important check on Mr. Taylor's movement for at
               least seven days preceding the shooting. "I played golf with Mr. Taylor
               exactly a week before his death. We drove to the San Gabriel Country Club and remained there from about noon
                  till dark. While there I introduced him to Asa
                  Keyes, the Deputy District Attorney." Mr.
                  Moreno said yesterday at his apartment, in the Los Angeles Athletic
                  Club.
            "The next day I saw him again. I met him at the
                  Ambassador at a party. Mr. Taylor was with Miss Claire
                  Windsor. I saw him leave the hotel with her.
               There were a number of picture people there that night.
                     "Saturday night--that is, a week ago
                     tonight--Mr. Taylor was here
                  in the club. He was in my room and
               with us were Arthur Hoyt and Capt.
                  Robertson, who is a close friend of Mr.
                  Taylor. We sat and talked a while. Then Mr.
                  Taylor, Mr. Hoyt and Capt.
                  Robertson left. Later I learned they drove to Cedar Grove,
                  near Pasadena, and had something to eat there. From there they drove
               to the Annandale Country Club.
            "I saw Mr. Taylor next at the Lasky studios, Monday morning
               at 10 o'clock. I had an appointment with him to go to the Vitagraph
                  studios, on a matter of business importance to me. Chester Bennett of the Brunton
                  studios, was with us. We were together until 12:30 p.m. that
                  day. "We were unable to see the people we wanted that day. The
                  appointment had to be made over again. I called Mr. Taylor again, Tuesday at the Lasky
                  lot, but I did not get to talk to him. I was informed that he was out
               on location on Mt. Lowe. Tuesday, which was the day
                  before the murder, I could not get in touch with him.
            "Wednesday night
               Mr. Taylor called me at the
                  club. I was in Mr. Hoyt's
               room, when the call came. We discussed the business appointment I wanted Mr. Taylor to participate in. As near as I can now recall it, it was
                  about 7 o'clock when Mr. Taylor
               called. He did not tell me much about his trip to Mt. Lowe.
            "Mr. Hoyt was present at the conversation. It lasted
                  several minutes. Mr. Taylor then
               made an appointment for Thursday
                     morning, at 10 o'clock. He appeared to be in best of spirits. He
               was pleasant and cheerful. "It was a few minutes after 7 that Mr. Taylor hung up. Then Mr.
                  Hoyt and I went to the club
                  dining-room and stayed there for dinner. "Thursday morning, Mr. Hoyt called me and told me I would not be able to keep
               the appointment with Mr.
                  Taylor because he was dead. He then told me what he read in the
               papers."
            The investigators
               last night began to check up the facts supplied by Mr. Moreno in an effort to supply the missing links and
               thus account for every action and movement of the slain director. Mr. Moreno's story supplied much important data, the
                  officers say.
