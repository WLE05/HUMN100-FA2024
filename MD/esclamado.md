            Coroner's Inquest Transcript

            The following is the transcript of the shorthand
                  notes taken at the Coroner's inquest
               held on the body of William Desmond
                  Taylor at Ivy H. Overholtzer [Mortuary] at
                  Los Angeles, California on the 4th day of February,
                  1922 at 10:00 a.m.

            CHARLES EYTON: NANCE, Coroner Charles Eyton,
               being first duly sworn, testified as follows:

            BY THE CORONER:

            NANCE: Please state your name.

            EYTON: Charles Eyton.

            NANCE: Where do you reside?

            EYTON: 1920 Vine Street, Hollywood.

            NANCE: What is your occupation?

            EYTON: General Manager, Famous Players-Lasky
                  Corporation.

            NANCE: Mr. Eyton, have you seen the
                  remains of the deceased in the
               adjoining room?

            EYTON: Yes, sir.

            NANCE: Do you recognize them as one you knew in life?

            EYTON: Yes, sir.

            NANCE: Who was it.

            EYTON: William Desmond Taylor.

            NANCE: Where was he born?

            EYTON: He was born in Ireland, to the best of my
               knowledge. He told me so.

            NANCE: What was his age?

            EYTON: Forty-four, I should judge. [He was forty-nine.]

            NANCE: Was he married, single or a widower?

            EYTON: He was married. [He was divorced as of 1916.]

            NANCE: When did he die?

            EYTON: Thursday morning or Wednesday night. I
               saw the body first on Thursday morning.

            NANCE: Last Thursday?

            EYTON: Yes, sir.

            NANCE: Do you recall that date?

            EYTON: It was the 2nd.

            NANCE: February 2nd?

            EYTON: February 2nd.

            NANCE: Where did he die?

            EYTON: EYTON: the EYTON: Apartment
                  "B," South Alvarado Street, 404 I think it was.

            NANCE: What was the cause of his death, if you know?

            EYTON: Well, Mr. Taylor's assistant [Harry
                  Fellows] rang me up at my residence about, I should
               judge, eight o'clock, and told me Mr. Taylor had died
               suddenly; so I immediately went over to his residence, and he
               was lying on the floor on his back.
                  Detective Ziegler was there and he had called the doctor, he told me,
               previous to my arrival; and the doctor told me Mr. Taylor had died from
               hemorrhage of the stomach. Mr. Maclean - Douglas
                  Maclean - had told me that he had thought he had heard a
                  shot
               the night before, and his wife also thought she had heard a
                  shot - and he wanted the body turned over;
               they didn't want to turn it over until the coroner came. The deputy coroner came
               after a while, and he told us he had died of hemorrhage of the
                  stomach, and I told him he had better turn the
                  body over to make sure, and he put his
               hand under Mr. Taylor's
               body, and found a little - when he pulled his
                  hand out, it had a little blood
               on his hand. Douglas asked him what that was,
               and he said it evidently had run down from his [Taylor's]
               mouth, but I noticed that there was no trail of
                  blood-Mr. Taylor's
               head was in a pool of blood - there
               was no trail of blood running down. 
            
            NANCE: There was a pool of blood under his
                  head?

            EYTON: Under his head, yes, a little
               pool of blood. I immediately opened up Mr.
                  Taylor's
               vest, and looked, and looked on the right-hand side, and
               there was no mark. I looked on the left-hand side and saw some
                  blood, and then I told the Deputy Coroner
               that I thought that evidence enough to turn his body over to
               see what would happen. I sent for a pillow to put under
               Mr. Taylor's
               head, and we turned him over - the Deputy
                  Coroner and myself - and we pulled his shirt and
               his vest up, and we found the bullet
                  wound. 
            
            NANCE: Mr. Eyton, was his body
               stone cold at that time?

            EYTON: Stone cold and very stiff and rigid.

            NANCE: Indicating that it had been dead for some time?

            EYTON: Yes.

            NANCE: Where was the body lying with reference
               to the front entrance to his
               home?

            EYTON: It was lying right in front of a little
                  desk with the head pointed east
               and the feet pointed west. I should judge the feet were
               three or four feet from the door - the front
                  entrance.

            NANCE: Who were present when you was there?

            EYTON: When I came in, the first man I noticed was Detective
                  Ziegler, whom I have known for a number of years, and Douglas
                  Maclean; Charles Maigne; the landlord [E. C.
                     Jessurun]; and Harry Fellows, Mr. Taylor's
               assistant director.

            NANCE: Did all of these persons live there in this
                  neighborhood?

            EYTON: That I could not tell you. Mr. MacLean did, I know,
               because he showed me where his apartment was.

            NANCE: The place Mr. Taylor lived was in a
                  court?

            EYTON: In a court, yes.

            NANCE: These other buildings were nearby?

            EYTON: There are several apartments in this
                  court, all the way around.

            NANCE: Did Mr. and Mrs. MacLean, or either of them, tell
               you about the hour that they heard the
               gunshot?

            EYTON: Yes, Mr. Maclean told me it was about
                  eight or a quarter after eight, and Mrs. Maclean
               thought it was a little later. [This is not correct.]

            NANCE: That night?

            EYTON: Yes, the night before.

            NANCE: You didn't make any definite measurements as to the position of
               the body?

            EYTON: No, sir.

            NANCE: So that what you testified to is only an estimate, and nothing
               definite about it.

            EYTON: Yes.

            NANCE: Now, how long has Mr. Taylor lived in this
               place?

            EYTON: That I could not tell you. He lived in it before he went to
                  the war, I believe.

            NANCE: When did you last see him alive?

            EYTON: The same day - Wednesday.

            NANCE: Now, did he have any fire-arms of his
               own?

            EYTON: I believe he had a revolver; I believe
               the revolver was in the upper
                  drawer
               upstairs; in fact, I know there was, because Detective
                  Ziegler and myself went up there and saw it.

            NANCE: When you were called to this place, did you see any
                  fire-arms in this room where he
               was?

            EYTON: No.

            NANCE: What is the name of his valet, or attendant there?

            EYTON: Harry Peavey, the colored cook. I never knew him or
               saw him.

            NANCE: Was he the one who called you?

            EYTON: Harry Fellows, his assistant director, was the one
               who called me.

            NANCE: You have no independent knowledge of the manner in which he met
               his death?

            EYTON: No, sire.

            THE CORONER: Have you any questions, gentlemen?

            NANCE: (By a Juror) Was his
                  clothing ruffled in any way, showing any violence?

            EYTON: No, absolutely none; it looked like he just walked in the
                  door and was shot in the back;
               that is the way it looked. It didn't show evidence in the room
               when I got there- neither the room or the
                  body showed any evidence of a struggle. He had on the
               same suit as when I seen him the day before
               when he talked to me.

            THE CORONER: Is there any other questions? That is all, you may be
               excused.
