                  Mr. Taylor, the deceased in
               this case?

            NANCE: Did you see him on the evening before his death occurred?

            NORMAND: Yes, I did.

            NANCE: And where did you see him?

            NORMAND: Will I tell you when I went in there
               and when I came out?

            NANCE: Did you see him at his home?

            NORMAND: Oh, yes.

            NANCE: And you were with him about how long on that occasion?

            NORMAND: I got there about 7 o'clock and left at a quarter to
                  8.

            NANCE: And when you left his place, did you leave
               him in the house, or outside?

            NORMAND: No, he came down to my car
               with me. 

            NANCE: Where was your car?

            NORMAND: Right in front of the court.

            NANCE: On Alvarado street?
            

            NORMAND: Yes, on the hill.

            NANCE: He accompanied you to your car?

            NORMAND: Yes.

            NANCE: Was he still there when you drove away?
            

            NORMAND: Yes, as my car turned around,
               I waved my hand at him; he was partly up a little stairs there.

            NANCE: At the time you were in the house, was anybody also in the house?

            NORMAND:Yes, Henry, his man.

            NANCE: Henry Peavey?

            NORMAND:Yes.

            NANCE: Do you know whether Mr. Peavey left the
                  house before you did or not?

            NORMAND:Yes, he did; he left about, I should say about 15 or 20
                  minutes before I left, but stopped outside and spoke to my chauffeur;
               we came out later.

            NANCE: No one else except Henry Peavey was
               there?

            NORMAND:That was all.

            NANCE: What time was it you say you left him--drove away from
                  his place?

            NORMAND:I left him on the sidewalk about a quarter to eight.

            NANCE: Did you expect to see him or hear from him later that
                  evening?

            NORMAND:Yes, he said--he had finished his dinner--he said would
                  I go out and take dinner with him and I said, "no;" I was tired; I had to
               go home and get up very early; he said he would
                  call me up in about an hour.

            NANCE: Did he call you?

            NORMAND:No, I went to bed; if he called me I was
               asleep; when I am asleep he tells my maid not to
               disturb me.

            NANCE: Was that the last time you saw him when you left
               him about a quarter to eight?

            NORMAND:That was the last time.

            NANCE: Have you any questions, Gentlemen? That is
               all, you may be excused.

               correctly took down in shorthand the testimony and proceedings had at the within
               named Coroner's inquest; that the foregoing is a
