            LOS ANGELES EXAMINER

             In a remarkable interview, given exclusively to the LOS
                  ANGELES EXAMINER, Mrs. Charlotte
                  Shelby, mother of Mary Miles Minter,
                  last night for the first time revealed hitherto unknown phases of the
                  William Desmond Taylor murder case.

             From the wealth of memories so closely associated with the career of her talented
               daughter she brought forth details that shed a new light on the many investigations
               that sought to unravel the tangled threads of the murder of the film director -- a
               case famous the world over.
            (continued below) 
             "Perhaps she went to dinner at someone's
                  house, it was suggested to me. We tried to reassure ourselves of this,
               but somehow I kept worrying about getting no telephone call and about that
               big, fast car and the foggy roads. 
             "We began to call up persons at the studio. We
               called the cameraman and the assistant cameraman. The cameraman, a big, jolly Irishman, was a favorite of Mary's. He was married and had small children. She was
               fond of children and occasionally stopped at his
                  house. The cameraman told us
               Mary had not been there. No one could remember
               seeing her leave the studio. 
             "We thought Mr. Taylor perhaps would know. But we
               did not have his phone number. No one seemed to know it. 
             "Then we remembered that one day
               Mary and her grandmother, Juliette B. Miles, went to Mr. Taylor's home
               for tea. 
             "Chauncey, our chauffeur, drove them, so we
               called Chauncey and asked him if he knew where
               Mr. Taylor lived. He said he thought he could
               find the place but did not know the
               address. 
             "So we started out, Chauncey, my secretary and
               I. 
             "We drove around and around. the chauffeur
               said he knew the neighborhood but was not
               certain of the exact location. Finally he remembered it. We stopped at the corner of Fourth and Alvarado streets. It was
                  close to midnight then. 
             "Chauncey said he did not know which bungalow was Mr.
                  Taylor's. There were a number of them," Mrs.
                  Shelby went on, making a wide sweep with her right arm. "As I remember it, there were some on the left, some on the right and some bungalows in the
                  back. 
             "I saw a light burning in a window on the right, so I rang the bell, or knocked, I don't remember which. Some one
               answered and I asked them if they knew where Mr.
                  Taylor lived. They pointed to a house on
                  the left side of the court, the last one in the back. I went there and
               rang the bell. The house was dark. 
             "Mr. Taylor's voice came from the second story window. 
             "'Who is there?' he asked." 
             "'This is Mrs. Shelby, Mr.
                  Taylor,' I answered. 
             "'I'll be right down,' he replied and in a short time opened the door and asked me
               to step in. 
             "I entered the room, a sort of combination living and dining room. Mr. Taylor showed much interest. He, too, appeared worried
               over Mary's absence. Then he suggested some more
               persons to call. I waited while he used the telephone. 
             "I remember that he stepped into a sort of a telephone
                  room -- an out of the way nook, and called. He talked to an assistant
               director, I think his name was Frank O'Connor,
               and he called several others. None had seen Mary or
               knew where she had gone. 
             "By this time we both were considerably worried. 
             "After some conversation, in which I mentioned my fears of an accident, I left." 
             "'Be sure to call me and let me know if anything had happened,' Mr. Taylor said as he bade me goodbye. I went to
               our car, where Charlotte Whitney, the secretary, waited for me, and we went
               home. 
             "I do not now remember the time of this visit. It was not, as has been whispered
               around, shortly before Mr. Taylor's
                  murder. I did not 'storm' into the
                  house, with a loaded revolver
               in hand, as has been whispered around. I did not threaten Mr.
                  Taylor, as has been said." 
            
               Miss Minter, Mrs.
                  Shelby said, came home some time later. 
             "She never told us where she had been that night. We were relieved to
               learn that there had been no accident and that she was well. 
             "But months later we learned about that trip. Frank
                  Urson, a dear friend of the family, and an old associate from Santa
               Barbara days, told me that he had run across Mary,
               driving her big roadster at 55 miles an hour and
               that he took her in tow and finally sent her home. He told me he feared she would meet with an accident and warned
               us against her habit of speeding. 
             "Certainly," Mrs. Shelby declared, "this incident
               is not a hot murder mystery clue. Certainly, had there been anything sinister in
                  that night visit, I would not have taken two witnesses me or made
               public inquiry for Mr.
                     Taylor's residence. 
             "And yet," Mrs. Shelby went on," some one related
               this story and some one has been keeping it alive, until today it is one of the
               endless chains of clues and rumors that keep bobbing up on the least provocation. 
             "What's more," Mrs. Shelby declared, this story,
               along with all sorts of others, was related to former District Attorney Asa Keyes. 
             "I made a complete statement to Mr. Keyes after he
               returned from New York. I held back nothing. Why
               this 'mystery' should be resurrected ever so often, is beyond me." 
             "To the world in general the Taylor murder case
               brought thrills, mystery and the glamour of big names, but to others it brought
               tragedy and sorrow," she said. 
             There was a long pause. 
             Perhaps the hectic days of the first Taylor case
               investigation were ringing through Mrs. Shelby's
               mind. Perhaps there came a train of thought that carried swiftly the amazing story of
               Mary's rise and the events that followed her
               famous director's unexplained murder. 
             If Mrs. Shelby thought about the $1,000,000 suit filed by her
                  daughter in 1926 and of her demand for accountings, for audits and
                  for return of money earned in the
                  films, she gave no indication of this. 
             And if the drama of that intense recital of Mary's visit to the body of Taylor, recalled to her a few minutes before,
               took her back to memories tinged with the romance of her beautiful daughter,
               Mrs. Shelby managed to hide her emotions. 
             Earlier in the interview some allusion was made to Mary Miles
                  Minter's glowing account of the slain director and to the love letters
               and tokens, most of them unidentified, found in his
                  apartment
               after the murder. 
             "I'm sure, Mr. Taylor was a gentleman," Mrs. Shelby said. 
             She hesitated a little, and then went on. 
             "I'm going to rip all this innuendo wide open -- there is no other way," she went
               on. 
             "I know that there have been reports that I was in love with Mr. Taylor and that I was jealous of my daughter and also feared that
               Mary's career would suffer, and that I killed
               Taylor to preserve my love and Mary's film future. 
             "I am repeating these things just to show the absurdity of them. How is it possible
               to have such a double motive? The mere repetition of it shows the absurdity of the
               whole thing. Killing Mr. Taylor would have wrecked
               Mary's career instead of saving it. 
             "But aside from that, the whole thing is ridiculous -- and vicious. 
             "I am a woman who has always stood alone. 
             "I was not in love with William Desmond Taylor. I
               was not in love with anyone. And no one was in love with me. I never held a purely
               social conversation with Mr. Taylor in my life. He
               was always aloof, a man of mystery, polished, distant and reserved. 
             "In those days my tasks and interests were few. I lived, talked,
               planned and worked only for Mary and her pictures. 
             "How utterly ridiculous, how unjust and criminal, to cast accusations of such flimsy
               nature, merely on 'clues' of such thin stuff. A crime without a motive, or reason." 
            
               Mrs. Shelby's references to Taylor were most impersonal. In fact, she said during the interview,
               Taylor himself was impersonal. 
             She came back to the night of February 1, 1922, when Taylor was shot and killed only a few minutes after
                  the vivacious Mabel Normand, his dinner guest
                     that night, left
               the bungalow of the man she, along with
               many others, admired. 
             She talked of Sands -- Edward F. Sands, the
               butler-valet of the slain director who robbed and flaunted
                  his employer because he knew of his checkered past. 
             Of the incidents leading up to and following the actual slaying of "Bill" Taylor, Mrs.
                  Shelby said but little. She refused to express an opinion. And of
                  Henry Peavey, the colored house boy and cook,
               who served dinner on the night of the
                  murder and left just before Miss
                     Normand, Mrs. Shelby also
               had little to say. 
             "I do not remember seeing him at the Taylor
               bungalow the night I called to see Mr. Taylor," was
               all she said. 
             "But this point seems to be overlooked generally when these vicious whispers are
               passed about," Mrs. Shelby added. 
             "The time of the murder was pretty well fixed. Mrs. Douglas MacLean, who heard the
                  shot, saw a man leave the
               Taylor
                  bungalow. Mrs. MacLean was in
               her own apartment, and from the front door, only a short distance away,
               saw this man and described him. 
             "Do I answer that description?" Mrs. Shelby said
               smilingly as she rose to her feet and held out her silk-encased arms. 
             "Dressed in men's clothes? But why" Why
               would a woman run the extra risk of being detected by wearing clothes in which she at once would become
               conspicuous? 
             "This whole affair, however, is far from a jest to us. As I have said before, I have
               made complete statements and stand ready to make them if needed and if they can be of
               any use. 
             "But I will not remain idle and be a target. From now on I am going to seek out
               those who circulate these rumors. 
             "I am back in California, the land I love. I am
               not in seclusion, as has been printed, nor am I hiding from any one or anything.
               There are some things that I must reserve for the future. Some of them may hold the
               solution to the motive for the circulation of these cruel rumors." 
            
               Mrs. Shelby rose to bid her interviewer good-by. 
             "You may add," she said smilingly, "that I will remain right here and that if I do move from this
                  charming apartment to our own home, I will not be in seclusion or in
               hiding."
