             Henry Peavey accuses Mabel Normand

             In 1922, and again in 1930, Henry Peavey stated that he believed Mabel
             Normand killed Taylor. For his 1922 accusation, see Wallace Smith's articles
             in TAYLOROLOGY 22 and 23. Below is the most detailed article containing his
             1930 accusation. Although the name of the actress is not mentioned in the
             article, Mabel Normand is certainly the person referred to, because she was
             admittedly with Taylor at that time on the evening of his death.

             LOS ANGELES RECORD
             San Francisco, Jan. 7--Henry Peavey, second missing witness in
               the
            
               William Desmond Taylor murder case, was found in a
                  northern California city
             today by the United Press.
             "I am willing to return to Los Angeles immediately and tell the grand
             jury all I know," the young Negro said.
             "I'll tell them more than the district attorney let me tell the first
             time."
             "Do you know who killed Taylor?" he was asked.
             "I'll tell that to the grand jury," he said, nervously. He had been
             awakened from a sound sleep. He arose and wrapped a dressing robe around
             himself.
             "Did you not confide in Dr. Thomas Filben that ----- (a motion picture
             celebrity was named) killed Taylor?"
             "Yes, I did."
             "Will you repeat it to the grand jury?"
             "Yes."
             Dr. Filbin, who befriended Peavey, is executive secretary of the
             California Law Enforcement League.
             The person accused by Peavey was the one named by Otis Hefner, another
             hitherto missing witness, in an exclusive statement to the United Press
            yesterday...
             "I'd been working for Mr. Taylor as valet for eight months before he was
             killed," Peavey said. "He was my best friend. I've got his picture right
             here on my dresser."
             The photograph took its place in a gallery of pictures of actresses, most
             of them in semi-nude poses.
             "I went to [sic] Mr. Taylor's house about 7 o'clock in the evening that
             he was shot. I wanted to check out for the day.
             "Before I opened the door I heard loud voices. One was a woman's. She
            was angry.
             "I waited around for ten minutes, but the quarrel kept up. I wanted to
             go downtown, and I didn't know whether to open the door or not."
            "Did you recognize the woman's voice?" he was asked.
             "Yes. I saw her, too, for pretty soon I got tired waiting outside and
             opened the door to speak to Mr. Taylor."
             "Who was she?"
             Peavey hesitated, nervously. His glance swept the room, decorated with
             table runners and handwork which Peavey made himself.
             "You told Dr. Filben who she was, didn't you?"
             "Yes, I did."
             "You named ----- ------ ?"
             He nodded his head, affirmatively.
             "Was that true?"
             "Yes, it was!" he cried in a high voice. "It was all true, every word of
             it! I'll go down to Los Angeles and tell it all to the grand jury. I'm not
             afraid!"
             "You didn't tell this at the coroner's inquest?"
             "No. They wouldn't let me. They tried to shake the story I told them
             before the inquest. They threatened me. I didn't change my story, because it
             was true, but I left out that part about the row at Mr. Taylor's house. Then
             I knew they would make more trouble for me, so I left Los Angeles right away."
             "Who do you mean by 'they'?"
             "The district attorney's office."
             "You told Dr. Filbin that when the district attorney was questioning you,
             you said repeatedly, 'Why do you pick on me? You know who killed Taylor.' Is
             that right?"
             "Yes, it is."
             Peavey's story had to be drawn by close questioning. He volunteered
             little.
             "At what time do you think Taylor was shot?"
             "Sometime between 7:10, when I finally spoke to him and left the house,
             and 7:30 p.m."
             "Why before 7:30?"
             "His chauffeur told me afterward that he telephoned Taylor from downtown,
             asking any further instructions for the day, at about half-past seven, and
             couldn't get an answer to the phone. Then he want to Taylor's house, but it
             was dark [sic] and the door was locked."
             "What time was it that the chauffeur went to the house?"
             "I don't remember. Not very long, I guess, because he wanted to get home
             himself."
             "What about this quarrel that was going on?"
             "Well, it was just a row, that's all. The woman was doing most of the
             talking. She was mad."
             "What have you been doing since you left Los Angeles?"
             "I came up to San Francisco and went to work for the Corona Typewriter
             company. That's where I met Dr. Filben, in the typewriter company office. He
             recognized my name and identified me with the Taylor case. He was nice to me,
             and finally when I got to know him I told him the whole story--the part they
             wouldn't let me tell in Los Angeles.
             "Then I came to this city and got a job as an actor. I played a part in
             'White Cargo.'
             "I've been around here since, and that's about all."
             The Negro section of the city where Peavey was found has been keeping him
            under cover for several days, since Dr. Filben gave his story to the United
             Press in San Francisco.
             A negro political leader was finally prevailed upon, after a number of
             blind leads had been followed, to assign a lieutenant to accopany the
             reporters to Peavey's home.
             He was found in a two-room apartment in the rear of a home which itself
             faced the street. He had as a room mate a Portuguese boy, who was not present
             at the interview.
             "Henry likes to do fancy work," the guide explained. "He's got it all
             over his place."
             He had, and upon the various runners and doilies was an assortment of
             powder boxes and paints.
             ...He speaks in a voice surprisingly high in register for his build. He
             is not well educated. The manager of the theater at which he plays occasional
             parts informed reporters that Henry's bits in "White Cargo" had to be read to
             him.
             "I'm innocent of any wrongdoing," Peavey assured his interviewers. "I've
             been working and earning an honest living and minding my own business.
             "My conscience is clear and I'm not afraid of anybody. I'm willing to go
            right down to Los Angeles and tell the whole thing to the grand jury.
             "They made me think, at the time Mr. Taylor was killed, that if I didn't
             keep my mouth shut about this quarrel and get out of Los Angeles that they
             might accuse me of the murder. Mr. Taylor was my close friend. I'm innocent.
             Now I'm ready to tell them all I know."...
