            # Interview with Charlotte Shelby
            *Katrina von Behren*


             December 26, 1929 A. M. Rochlen LOS ANGELES EXAMINER

            In a remarkable interview, given exclusively to the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, mother of Mary Miles Minter, last night for the first time revealed hitherto
               unknown phases of the William Desmond
                     Taylor murder case. From the wealth of memories so
               closely associated with the career of her talented
                  daughter she brought forth details that shed a new light on the many
               investigations that sought to unravel the tangled threads of the murder of the film director -- a case famous the world
               over. "The time for action has come. I'm not going to sit idly and be a target for
               base rumors and vicious innuendo. there must be some justice in this world -- even
               for a helpless woman." Breaking a silence of more than seven eventful years,
                  Mrs. Shelby, one of the dramatic and
               ever-interesting figures of the Taylor case,
               thus struck back at the endless chain of "whispers and theories" linking her, as well
               as others, in the events of that baffling
                  mystery. Of Mary Miles Minter, who
               was a film star under Taylor's direction, she had
               little to say. 

            What here is disclosed would remain forever in her own heart, she said, were it not for the rumors, reports and
               insinuations that are making her life a dreadful dream. Desiring only to be left
                  alone, Mrs. Shelby now feels that she must cut
               through the web of whispers and suspicions to bring to an end the repetitions of her
               name in connection with the case. And she wants to serve notice that every recourse
               of law will be brought to bear to stop unwarranted bantering of her name and to force
               those who have used it to come out in the open. "I have made complete statements to
               the proper authorities in the past and I stand
               ready to do it again if it will help in a sincere and honest effort to solve
                  the mystery of Mr.
                  Taylor's death," Mrs. Shelby said in
               the interview. "But somewhere, somehow, this thing has got to
               stop. I demand it. We cannot go through life like this -- I and my daughter, Margaret. We
               are not hiding from anyone one anything. All we ask is to be left alone, and somebody
               has got to help us fight this terrible thing." For the purpose of an earnest and
               legitimate investigation, Mrs. Shelby revealed for
               the first time to THE EXAMINER last night that -- She was not in love
               with William Desmond Taylor. She did not make
               threats against the famous director.


            She did not go to Taylor's bungalow at 404B South
                  Alvarado Street at an early morning hour
               several weeks before the murder, armed with a
                  revolver. She did not, shortly before the murder,
               purchase a gun and practice with it. "I know that
               some of these things, with many vicious details added, had been whispered around,"
               Mrs. Shelby said. "How most of them originated, no one knows. Some, I'm sure, were
               spread by a person formerly in my employ. I know that person and I know the motive.
               At the proper time and place I shall make known this motive, but in the meantime I am
               interested in just this: "I want to find out who circulates these rumors. I want to
               get definite information of definite statements against me, and then I am going to
               take definite action to the limit of my ability and the law." Mrs. Shelby's
                  blue eyes lost some of their softness as
               she spoke. Only a few minutes before she came into the room to greet
                  the visitor. Attired in a soft, clinging Viennese gown of golden brown, with brown suede shoes
               to match, she sat near the window of her charming
                  apartment in a court that looked like a corner of some far-away nook
               in old Granada. Outside Christmas crowds and laden
                  automobiles moved back and forth. Margaret
                  Shelby Fillmore, always a close pal and companion of her mother, sat
               nearby. 

             The two had but recently returned from Europe. France, Belgium, Germany,
                  Switzerland and Italy. Paris, London, Vienna -- art
               museums and Florence -- and then all the crash and
               cruel reverberations of the old Taylor case. "We arrived in California
               November 17. For more than three years we lived in
                  Europe. You know, there are many things we
               do not discuss with the outside world. There are many sorrows one must always bear
               alone or with those who are very near and close. "My daughter and I (to Mary Miles Minter, Mrs. Shelby never alluded as "my
               daughter") traveled and saw everything that was beautiful in old Europe, but now we are back -- and to all this."
                  As Mrs. Shelby talked, framed against the
                  deep window and the dazzling white
                  walls of the courtyard, there
               flashed before the interviewer another
                  occasion, almost eight years ago, when
                   Mrs. Shelby was an actress in a drama in which
                  Mary Miles Minter was playing the leading part.
               It was in the artistic living room of their
                  home, on North Hobart boulevard, in
                  February 1922.  William Desmond
                  Taylor, a man of mystery and romance, a leading figure in the motion
               picture world, was murdered in his home
               a few nights before. One by one several beautiful women -- names known
               throughout the world -- were brought into the case. And Mary
                  Miles Minter, young, vivacious, and then at the height of her
                  artistic career, was one of these. Mary, her face like a Greek profile of
               exquisite marble, sat on a couch and told of her last visit with Taylor -- in the
               darkened chamber of the undertaking parlors. She had gone there alone to place a
               beautiful dark red rose on the body of the man who was her director, friend, ideal.
               And Mrs. Shelby, close by, listened to the story and watched over Mary.


             But yesterday, as the brilliant Christmas afternoon was
               changing into evening, it was a different story. "Yes, I remember that
               night, nearly eight years ago," Mrs. Shelby replied, and paused. "I want
               to forget it. Of Mary I shall have nothing to say.
               She is in good hands and can take care of herself, I'm sure. "In those days my whole
               life was wrapped up in her. It was my work. Now I must fight for vindication. I've
               had enough of this, and I am going to ask that they put an end to the case once and
               for all." Throughout the entire discussion Mrs.
                  Shelby was careful not to express any opinion on who killed Taylor. "Mr. Taylor is
               dead. My daughter Margaret and I are still alive.
               We must be protected and not crushed by this gossip. "That's why," she continued,
               "the truth must be revealed, the truth must be spoken, the truth must be printed.

            "Of course I have heard the dastardly whisperings about me and my connection with the
               case. I have heard them all -- that I was in love with Mr. Taylor, that I owned a
                  gun and used to practice on a target a short time before
               the murder, that I went to Mr. Taylor's apartment early one morning searching for Mr. Taylor and
               threatening him with death, that I had made many other threats, and so on and on. 

            "Each and every one of these rumors and whisperings is ridiculous". 

            Let us take them one by one and see," she declared.

            "I did have a gun."

            "It was given to me by a jeweler friend of ours in Santa
                  Barbara, way back in 1916. That was a long time
                  before Mr. Taylor was killed.

            "We were living in Santa Barbara. I was Mary's business manager. I had to read the stories for her
                  pictures, work on the scenarios, watch over her
                  clothes, the cast, everything.

            "We lived alone. No men folks in the household. Our friend brought the gun to the
                  house one night. He said I must keep
               it.

             "'But I don't know how to use it. I never held one in my hand before,' I told him. 
            "'Well, let's learn,' he replied."

            Mrs. Shelby smiled.

            "You know, this really bears a strange element of humor, now that I look back on
               it.

             "We went out to some open spaces and I took this gun in my
               right hand. It was a pretty little thing -- had a pearl handle and all that. I
               pointed the gun at something or other, shut my eyes and
               pulled hard. The thing went 'boom' and threw my arm back.

             "I did that several times in succession. That was all."

            "Still, they call it target practice."

            Mrs. Shelby said she did not remember what had become of the
                  gun. She says she has no recollection of bringing it back
               to Los Angeles when the household moved from
               Santa Barbara.

             "That much for target practicing," she declared.

            "Now about that visit to Mr. Taylor's house.

            "To understand it, I must take you back a few years. I must ask you to
               keep in mind the fact that Mary was at the height
               of her career, was making big pictures. We had been in New York. I negotiated new
               contracts. There were trips and conferences and all that. Many, many details that
               play no part here, except incidentally as they relate to the contacts made with a
               former employee for whom I sent to New York and
               who later figured in the visit story.

            "We were back in California. Mary's contract originally called for pictures to be made
               in New York. One day
               Mr. Adolph Zukor held a conference with us. It was
               decided that climatic conditions were better out here on the
                  Coast for the type of picture Mary
               was making. So we came out.

            "Mr. Taylor was Mary's director.

            "About the time of this much-discussed visit Mary
               bought a new car. It was a big, fast roadster, and Mary liked speed. She used to go out, tearing along the
               roads at 60 and 70 miles an hour. I was her mother and it worried me --
               naturally.

            "We were living on Fremont place. At
                  that time of the year there was lots of fog at nights.

            "One night Mary did not come home to dinner. We
               waited and waited. She did not call. We began to worry.
