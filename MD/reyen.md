            *Kate Reyen*

            CHRISTINA JEWETT, maid for Mrs. MacLean
               Statement taken 2-9-22 

            (Witness after explaining that she was waiting between the service of courses to the
                  MacLeans, states as follows) 

            JEWETT: While I was waiting there I heard a man come from the
                  corner and go down in the alley and
                  he stopped right near against a big
                  fence there in the alley, and it
               seems to me he stopped just between the
                  garage and Mr. Jesserun's house.
                  He had flat shoes on, I know
               that.

            POLICE: You think it was a man's steps?

             JEWETT: Yes. When I came in after she rang the bell I heard
                  him move around just as she rang the
                  bell for me, and I went up and walked in and then I came
               out from the dining room, then was I heard
                  him walking, I thought he walked in
               between the buildings and between the
                  garage and the house,Mr. Jesserun living in * *
               and then I cleared out the table and as I cleared out the
                  table and was going to take out the
                  tablecloth was then I heard the shot. Yes, in the
               morning, the next morning * * * around the back in the alley *
               * * I heard somebody coming behind me. I turned my head, I saw Mr.
                  Taylor's man who drives the machine and he said "Good morning." He was
               in a great hurry and I thought well, he is late * * * because he is supposed to have
               the machine out I guess before 8 o'clock in front for Mr.
                  Taylor ** I guess just about 8 o'clock. (Witness quoting
                  Mrs. MacLean) She says "Come up stairs". I says "All right."
               I come up stairs. She says "Mr. Taylor was shot last night."
               "Oh' I said "Was he, that is what I heard," and she said "Yes." I think I said to
                  Mrs. MacLean "That is the man I heard in the
                  alley. POLICE: Are you sure Mrs. MacLean told you
               when you went up-there ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äî you say at 8 o'clock

            JEWETT: In the morning.

            POLICE: Are you sure Mrs. MacLeantold you at that time
                  Mr. Taylor had been shot? JEWETT: Yes.

            POLICE: What time of the day was that?

            JEWETT: 8 o'clock in the morning.POLICE: Can you think of that remark
                  Mrs. MacLean said "Mr. Taylor is shot."
               Didn't she say, "Mr. Taylor is dead."

            JEWETT: No, she said "Mr. Taylor has been shot."



            CHARLES DOUGLAS MacLEAN, Neighbor Statement taken
                  2-9-22 at ten MACLEAN: M.

            MACLEAN: I told the officers what occurred the night
                  of the murder * * I was late for dinner. I 'was
               5 minutes late. We had dinner at 7 o'clock. I must have taken another 5
               minutes to get ready. We sat down I should judge 10 minutes after 7. We
               sat there and I guess it took a half hour to eat dinner.

            MACLEAN: So I immediately after dinner got up from the
               table, went upstairs to get the
                  heater. I went in the front room
               and lighted the gas radiator. Also lighted the gas
                  radiator in the backroom upstairs,
               and I went in the front room and got my house
                  coat and put it on and went into the bath
                  room and detached the heater, when I heard
               the noise or explosion, it sounded like a shot. (Speaking of Mr.
                  Taylor's body on the morning of its discovery.)

            POLICE: What was the condition of the clothing, if you know.
               Was it disarranged at all?

            MACLEAN: No, not at a11. He looked immaculate.

            POLICE: How was he lying?

            MACLEAN: He was lying flat on his back, his feet separated a little, his legs apart
               and his hands at his sides, lying perfectly on his back.

            POLICE: Why is coat appeared to be arranged you may say,
               just like he was laid out by friends.

            MACLEAN: Yes, he was perfect.

            MACLEAN: As I remember the coat laid perfectly along his
               body. It wasn't thrown back over or anything.

            POLICE: Was his coat buttoned?

            MACLEAN: I don't think so.

            MACLEAN: He looked just like a dummy in a
                  department store or in a window of
               a store, so perfect, so immaculate. I remember I was impressed
               with the fact he looked like a wax figure dressed up.




            MRS. FAITH MACLEAN: neighbor Statement taken on 2-9-22 POLICE:
               When did you first learn that Mr. Taylor was dead? 

            MACLEAN: At 7:30
               Thursday morning.

            POLICE: Who was it that brought it to your attention?

            MACLEAN: His colored servant came screaming out of
                  the house.

            POLICE: What did he say?

            MACLEAN: "Help, Police, Mr. Taylor is
               dead."

            POLICE: Did the fact that Mr. Taylor was dead remind you of
               anything that occurred the night before * did you hear a
               shot.

            MACLEAN: Yes, what we thought might be a shot or a muffler
               explosion, I do not know which.

            POLICE: When did you hear that?

            MACLEAN: Sometime probably between quarter of eight and eight o'clock on
                  Wednesday evening.

            POLICE: Now, at the time you heard this shot did you go out on the
                  porch?

            MACLEAN: Yes, shortly after *** oh, about, I suppose three or four seconds, maybe a
               minute.

            MACLEAN: No I did not I just opened my front door.

            POLICE: Well, what did you say?

            MACLEAN: I saw a man had already opened the door of
                  Mr. Taylor's house and was looking towards
                  Alverado St. *** I didn't see him open the
                  door; it was already open I think.

            POLICE: Which way was the screen?

            MACLEAN: The screen door was open. I think the
                  screen door was open then it must have been to have seen
               his figure as clearly as I did.

            POLICE: Did he shut the door?

            MACLEAN: It seems like he shut the door. It seems like he
               leaned in and pulled it closed.

            MACLEAN: So it must have been opened because I distinctly saw his
                  cap.

            POLICE: You are satisfied are you, that the light came from Taylor's
                  apartment out on the street through the
                  open door?

            MACLEAN: Yes.

            POLICE: Did he seem in a hurry?

            MACLEAN: No, he was the coolest thing I have ever seen * * *. He turned around and
               looked at me and hesitated. Then it seems as if * * * that Mr.
                  Taylor must have spoken to him from inside the house 
               *** he thought he had spoken and he didn't. Seemed like he
               pulled the door shut, then turned around and looking at me
               all the time, walked down a couple of steps that go up to Mr. Taylor's
                  house there.
            POLICE: Do you know whether the man that you saw went to Alvarado
                  St. through the open court there?

            MACLEAN: He went towards Maryland St. and towards
                  the alley in between the two houses
               because he was facing that way ready to go when I closed the
                  door.

            POLICE: You knew it wasn't Taylor.

            MACLEAN: Oh, I knew it wasn't Taylor.

            POLICE: Could you have recognized the man 1f it had been Mr.
                  Taylor.

            MACLEAN: Oh, yes, positively. 

            POLICE: Now, is it possible that it might have been this young man Howard
                  Fellows, the chauffeur, that you saw there. Could that be possible.

            MACLEAN: I suppose it could be possible but it doesn't seem to me that he was the boy
               or was the man. He doesn't seem the built of that man.

            POLICE: Did the man you saw have a smooth face?

            MACLEAN: Yes, he did have a smooth face.

            POLICE: Did the man you saw have on anything like a chauffeur's
                  uniform?

             MACLEAN: Well, the only thing I noticed was his cap,
               something tied around his throat. I don't know whether the man had an
                  over-coat or not.

            MACLEAN: His age I don't know but I should judge the man was probably between 30 and
               35. He was about 5 feet nine, just about ***, and he was stocky, not
               fat, but stocky. He had on a cap. It seemed like a checked
                  cap with a plaid in it, and he wore something around his
               throat.

            POLICE: Smooth shaven?

            MACLEAN: Yes.

            POLICE: Color of his suit?

            MACLEAN: No, except it was a dark suit.

            POLICE: Now didn't compare in size with Mr. Smith,the
                  reporter here, who is taking this statement? (Mr.
                  Smith was about 5' 7 1/2")

            MACLEAN: No, Mr. Smith is shorter. (The witness names the
               following men: Mr. Henry King, Mr. Mahlon Hamilton, Mr. Arthur Hoyt, Mr. Berris (first
               name Nigle?), Mr. Ince, Mr. Marshal Neilan. Witness was then asked the following
               questions)

            POLICE: Now then, tell me whether there is any possibility that this man you saw
               coming out of there was any of the persons that you have mentioned?

            MACLEAN: No, I think not. I think I would have recognized any of those people.

            ** when he came out he was dressed as my idea of a moving picture
                  burglar**? ** because I remember thinking perhaps he might have been
               one of the boys in Mr. Taylor's company when they go out on
               location. MACLEAN: Not well dressed. I don't know as I would say slovenly but I don't
               think he was well dressed.
