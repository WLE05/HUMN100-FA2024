             STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT
               ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Part 4]
                  Marshall said that to me, and looked right at me. I could
               feel myself grow red. I said, "Is that all you have to tell me about Mr
                  Taylor?" He said, "Well, I could recite some more instances about
                  Bill's seeming insanity." He said, "I am certain he was
               insane. He stood up and told those things as soberly as I am talking to you now." 
             MR MOTT: Excuse me. Did he refer to Mr Taylor's physical
               condition? 
             MINTER: Yes, he said he was drunk at the time. Marshall has
               told ma on several occasions, sometimes long ago and sometimes recently that he
               always hated to see Bill drink because he said, "You wouldn't
               know the man; he changes so; he gets maudlin and silly, smiles in a foolish manner
               and wobbles and talks, oh, just the silly, foolish things." He said, "None of his
               friends like to see him drink." At this time he was intoxicated and he talked on and
               on and on about this thing." Marshall said he got up and he told
                Bill, "You are insane; something 1s the matter with your
               mind. I would certainly take more vengeance on you if I didn't think you were crazy,"
               and that was tbe opinion of Arthur Hoyt and Cap
                  Robinson and everybody. They were perfectly amazed that a man of
               Mr Taylor's lovable, sweet, considerate, gentlemanly
               disposition all through life should suddenly turn around and say this about not only
               a woman, but about me, whom they all knew he admired and respected. 
             When I heard of this thing, l just looked to Marshall and said,
               "Is that all you have to tell me about Mr Taylor?" And he said,
               "Yes, that is all. That 1s the ghastly thing. I know you are going to hear this from
               somebody and I wanted you to hear it from me, and want to find out what you knew
               about the murder of this man." 
             By this time I was getting -- Oh, how can I can I express it? -- just exhausted with
               shock, one shock after another and of all the shocks I had received, this coming from
               hlm who I had no reason to doubt his word, I couldn't believe it; not as I knew
               Mr Taylor, I couldn't believe for an instant he had ever said
               these things to anybody, yet there Marshall giving me names,
               dates and places. The thing was too much for me. I got furious; and I said, "I don't
               believe you! I think you are lying! How dare you say this about him to me! I never
               want to see you again?" He got up and walked around the room for a minute and I was
               just broiling; I was just furious; and he turned around and he said, "Well,
                  Mary, some day you will realize that I certainly am not
               saying this for any personal reason. It hurts me as it must hurt you. I am simply
               telling you because you are bound to know it; it is the truth and I wanted to be the
               one to tell you. 
             Well, I didn't have any more to say to him. I was just furious; I was furious with
               him; and finally he talked and he said, more, more, more personal things about, "You
               know Mary that I care for you." 
             DORAN: He told you he loved you, did he? 
            MINTER: Yes; he did on Friday night. He said, "You know I care for you deeply." 
             I said, "I don't care; I don't want you to care for me; I don't want John
                  Jones to care for me or anybody; I don't want ever to be in love again
               as long as I live; I don't want to see any man; I hate men." I probably raved on. 
             I dont know what more I can tell you. I was so tired, exhausted; I had been sitting
               up all night. This conversation didn't come as quickly as I am te11ing it to you. It
               came with long pauses; he would get up and walk around with his cigarette smoking and
               come back again and go out and talk to the property man, go out of the office, and I
               would sit there alone and I tore a piece of paper, I was so tired, and suggested that
               we go home. I said, "Why keep sitting up? 
             You have got to get up at eight o'clock in the morning and it is nearly dawn." He
               aaid, "I am worried about this thing; I want to find out what you know about this
               murder." Then it developed that Marshall thought I knew
               something about it, and he looked at me and he said, "Now, Mary"
               -- he got a little profane, he said, "Now, Mary, for God's sake,
               if you know anything about the murder of Bill tell it to me
               now." He said, "Don't withhold anything." This was too much; not only had he been
               telling me these things about Mr Taylor, but there he sat
               evidently believing that I knew someth1ng. I said, "Do you think that I killed Mr
               Taylor?" He said, "Oh, no; don't be silly. Now is no time to talk things like that. "
               He said, "I am just trying to find something out about this. This is going to be an
               awful affair." I said, "I didn't kill William Desmond Taylor and I don't know who
               murdered him." He said, "You don't? You don't know anything?" He said, "Of course,
               you didn't kill him; of course, you didn't put anybody on to do it, But" he said,
               "don't you know somebody, don't you know some intiÂ­mate details that other people
               might not know? Can't you rack your brain and think who would have a motive for
               killing him?" 
             Then he sat there and we said words about pro and con, trying to think, and I
               thought over everyrody I knew and I said this, more or less in a humourous way, I
               said, "The only person I know who could have had a possible motive for killing him
               would be Mrs. Julia Crawford Ivers." I was not serious when I said that. I was more
               or less humorous. She is a lady I feel I ought to explain about, who has never done
               me a wrong thing in her life and I have never done her a wrong thing, either, but she
               is a Christian Science lady who has been associated with him as a scenario writer for
               many years; she is quite a trusted, lovely woman, I am sure; a very honorable
               respectable woman, but we don't like eaeh other. There is no reason, but we don't
               like each other. Every time I wanted to see him, somehow she would be there and she
               had a strange way of treating me. She would say, Oh yes, there is little Mary. Here
               she comes." She would go on in this manner, "Oh, there is little Mary again, Oh,
               there she is; wbat can she be want1ng this time? Oh, yes, uh huh." Quite a strange
               attitude, She just riled me. 
             DORAN: Bow old a woman was she? 
             MINTER: She must have been 50. Her son was Mr Taylor's camera man. Jimmy was my
               camera man, Jim Vantrees. I don't hate the woman, but she annoys me. She is one of
               the few people in the world I dislike to see. In fact, the irony of fate it was when
               I was in France after looking at the beautifUl Venus de Milo in Paris at the Louvre,
               and after I had walked a few steps done a long hall, thinking of this excellent
               statue, who should I see but Julia Crawford Ivers, a very, fat, large woman. She did
               some more of these Christian Science things, and she had a very unpleasant habit of
               whenever she would be with me and Mr Taylor, she would always come and twit my chin.
               So I said, in really a joking manner -- I don't want to accuse the woman, because I
               don't think she had anything to do with the matter -- I said "I don't know anyone who
               would kill him but Ju1ia Crawford Ivers." "I always suspected the woman of being in
               love with him herself or she might have killed him tor that reason." He said, "My
               goodness! You mustn't say that out loud; somebody w111 believe you." I said, "I don't
               care if they do." I was in such a wild mood, Then, -- What else did we talk about?
               Oh! He talked about his productions and said, "I certainly have a terrible time,
               working day and night and a great deal depended upon Saturday and we must get certain
               work finished Friday." We talked of Friday night and that he had to get up at eight
               o'clock; he wasn't going to bed at all; that the boys were calling for him at eight
               o'clock, he said, and he knew if they didn't call he would never get up out of his
               slumbers. They were going somewhere on location, I understood, possibly at the
               studio. He was just going home and take a shower, get a shave if he felt like it, and
               go on back and work some more. He said, "I am dog tired. I was never so exhausted,
               just dead." Finally I said, "Do you rea1ize this looks awful, being here all this
               time?" And he said, "I can't help it if it does. I had to tell you these things and
               wanted to find out what you knew about this case. That I know you knew Bill very
               well, probably better than any of us and" -- Oh, yes. He also asked me to tel1 him my
               feelings toward Mr Taylor, exactly what everybody has been asking me, and I told him
               as I have been telling you, I loved him deeply, sincerely and absolutely; that I
               loved him truly, loved him in an all-around way, I cared for his health; his health
               came before my happiness and when he was ill -- and he didn't like to see anyone when
               he was ill-- my natural impulse was to go to him and be with him and sit up night
               after night with him, if necessary. l didn't do it; I didn t even attempt to, because
               he didn't want me to, and although I had sat in the dark, not knowing anything and
               worrying about it, I did that rather than intrude myself upon him when he didn't want
               me. 
             DORAN: What time of night dld you first meet -- What is this man's name? 
             MINTER: Mr Neilan? 
             DORAN: Mr Neilan, this particular night. 
             MINTER: We went down to the Salt Lake station after one. 
             DORAN: And you arrived at your home, was it, or his home or whose home was it where
               you were frying the eggs? 
             MINTER: His home, Friday night; it was really Saturday morning, wasn't it? I call lt
               Friday night, because it was still nighttime. The five of us arrived there, oh, I
               don't know, he didn't finish work until between two-thirty and three o'c1ock, maybe
               after three; I didn't have a watch at that time. 
             DORAN: Row long approximatey do you suppose you spent talking in the studio? 
             MINTER: Now, let me see, we stayed at Marshall's house wtth the eggs and things at
               least an hour, maybe two hours; I am not certain of that at all; I don't think much
               more than an hour. Then we went right on to the studio, 
             DORAN: Do you suppose you spent a couple of hours down there? 
             MINTER: I think maybe we spent a couple of hours; maybe three hours; it takes a good
               while to go from Salt Lake station up to Marshall's home on Sunset Boulevard. It
               would take at least forty-five minutes, I think. Then it takes some time to go from
               his home to the studio, way out on Santa Monica Boulevard. 
             DORAN: Where was the studio? 
             MINTER: On Santa Monica Boulevard, the Hollyood Studios. 
             DORAN: Did you suggest that you go down there with him? 
             MINTER: He said, "Let's go on down" -- No, the first thing he said was "Let's get
               out of here. I am burning up alive." It was very cold when we came in the house and
               we put on steam and then he got terribly hot. I don't know what was the matter with
               me, I wouldn't take off my coat. He said, "If you are going to stay there and burn,
               let's go out and talk." We got in the car and drove around for a while. No, it is not
               a fact that he said in the house, "We must go to the studio and talk." I think I said
               that at first; it is not so. He said, "Let's go out and talk." Then it was very
               bitterly cold outside, freez1ng ocld. 
             DORAN: You left the rest of the party at the house? 
             MINTER: No; Miss Swanson and Mr Pickford got in Mr Pickford's Locomobile and he said
               he ms going to take her home. She was very anxious to get to bed as she had to get up
               early and work. 
             DORAN: Then, you and Marshall Neilan drove around awhile and finally wound up in the
               studio? 
             MINTER: Yes; we drove around, went out Sunset Boulevard and went up -- We went along
               Hollywood Boulevard for a while, 
             DORAN: What did you discuss while you were riding around in the machine? 
             MINTER: Why, about this thing about Mr Taylor and then also I was rather peeved na
               Marshall at the time because I hadn't heard from him in weeks. "Peeved" is hardly the
               word. That sounds more as if I am interested in Marshall, and I am; I like him, but l
               wasn't caring particularly; I simply said, "Well, Marshall, it was not a very nice
               thing the way you ran off the last time. I understood they were going out to dinner
               and you were coming to my house to dinner and suddenly you went to San Francisco
               without so much as a fare-thee-well."' He said, "You know I do those things." I said,
               "Yes, you do those things, and it ts very annoying, but your friends love you and
               love you yet in spite of those funny little tricks you do, darting here and there. I
               don't know, I am in no mood to take thia foolishness; I want good wholesome
               friendship, but I want to know when you are going to appear." Many times a whole
               dinner has gotten cold waiting for him. When we had a dinner party at our house, or
               other people have given parties, they have waited on Marshall for two or three hours
               and he finally would come along smiling sweetly at everybody and they couldn't scold
               him. I was more or less taking him to task for his 1ife in general, saying he should
               not do those things; it was very annoying and I was not going to put up with it. He
               was sweet and Irish and said, "You wouldn't be angry with me?" And I said, "No, I
               wouldn't be." That is the way we got out of that. There was nothing serious in the
               talk, Just the way we always talked. 
             DORAN: Then you finally went to the studio? 
             MINTER: Finally he said, "Now, I have got something very important to tell you,
               something that is going to hurt your feelings terribly, but I must tell you; we wi11
               go in the studio and talk." Our teeth were chatter1ng with cold and we went in there
               and he turned on the steam and I sat in this fur coat in a wicker chair, and he said,
               "This is going to b, a nine or "nineteen-days talk of the world" Then he told me all
               the things I have been telling you. There may have been some more, and some thlngs I
               have said may not be exactly accurate, but the gist of the thing is entirely
               accurate. 
             DORAN: Did he declare his love for you, whi1e rid1ng around in the machine? 
             MINTER: No, he did not. 
             DORAN: Not until you reached the studio did he do tha that? 
             MINTER: Not until after we had been there a long time at the studio. 
             DORAN: Was it before or after he told you about this instance in connection with
               Taylor -- 
             MINTER: It was afterwards. I don't know yet whether he really meant it; maybe he was
               as sincere as he could be, and he can be very sincere, I am sure. I am sure he can.
