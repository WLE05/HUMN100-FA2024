            STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT
               ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Section 2]

            MINTER: My last director was Frank Urson. Mr.
                  Taylor so often, often made the remark to me that he wished tbat he
               were younger; he wanted to be younger. We undoubtedly would have been married today
               bnd he been younger. He explained our not. being engaged in that
               way. I knew we never could be married; I also knew I never would love for another
               human being in the way I cared for him. So he would say, "You know,
                  Mary, to me you are the morning sun, bright, beaut1ful, and
               with the world and a futune before you, and I am the setting sun, and don't you see,
               my dear, it simply cannot be. I hope tbat doesn't give you the impression that I
               begged him to marry me. I never did in my life. I couldn't do that. I never even
               called him "Billie" in my life. The man was too wonderful for that. He was wonderful.
               I don't care what anybody says or what they prove against him. I knew him as the
               finest thing in the world. 

             MR MOTT: He as the embodyment of your ideal? 

            MINTER: Yes, and I can aay now that I can't truthfully -- I don't know any of those
               ugly things which have been aaid about him. I never found him so. He was glorious to
               me. 

             MR DORAN: I read in the paper where you had been
                  engaged to some other man.

            MINTER: To Mr Dickson. That is not entirely true.

            DORAN: What is his first name?

             MINTER: Thomas Dickson.

            DORAN: Someone besides him, a director in the movies.

            MINTER: Marshall Neilan, engaged to
               him?

            DORAN: Yes, Marshall Neilan. Didn't I read in the
                  papers that you had been engaged to him and the
                  engagement had been broken off? 

            MINTER: That is not true. Mr Dickson is the only one to whom I
               have been even remotely engaged, and that was a freak of despondency.

            DORAN: What about Marshall Neilan? Were you engaged to him?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Had you been going with Marshall Neilan during, say the
               last thirty or sixty days prior to Taylor's
               death?

            MINTER: Going with him?

            DORAN: Had you been out anywhere with him? 

            MINTER: Yes; he had been to see me; I had been out with him; I
               am not sure whether it was within the thirty days or not, but in the
                  last two months, yes sir; but going with him no more than I had for
               years off and on. Mr Neilan's traits [page 9] are well known; he
               comes to see you, and we are always glad to receive him, but we never know how long
               he is going to stay with us or how long he was going to stay with this one or that
               one. He flits here and there like a swallow. We are all charmed with his personality,
               but don't take him seriously. 
            DORAN: Has he proposed to you?

            MINTER: Must I answer that? Yes, he did.

            DORAN: Do you recall approximately when it was?

            MINTER: About two months ago.

            DORAN: That would take it to December 1st, approximately or in the
               middle of December?

            MINTER: Well, I think it was after that, Yes -- No, let me see, December
                  1st -- I wish I could tell you.

            DORAN: With reference to this December 23d that you called on Taylor,
               when was it?

            MINTER: It as before the 1st of December, I think.

            DORAN: Q. Before the 1st of December?

            MINTER: Yes; about the last of November. 

            DORAN: And you, of course, rejected im, I suppose?

            MINTER: Yes; that is, I didn't exactly say, "No, I will not marry you." I didn't take
               him seriously. I joked with him at the time.

            DORAN: Did he seem to be serious?

            MINTER: You never know. I couldn't say whether ee was serious or not. I thought
               possibly he was joking, or had a few cocktails.

            DORAN: How many times after that did he mention the subject to
               you?

            MINTER: He didn't mention the subject. "May I marry you" again; he didn't say that,
               but he has been on very friendly terms with me and then suddenly go away to
                  San Francisco. and I wouldn't hear from him and I would
               remark, "Isn't that just like Marshall?" and thought no more of
               it. 
            DORAN: Well, but along toward the last thirty days prior to
                  Taylor's
               death, he seemed to be quite devoted to you, did
                  he not?

            MINTER: No; I can't really say that he did. As for being with him, wasn't with
                  him very much.

            DORAN: Didn't you observe in him some jealousy?

            MINTER: Oh, no; No, I can't say that. He was not jealous of me. He is the least
               jealous man I ever met. He takes life too much -- 
            DORAN: Did he ever say anything to you about
                  Taylor?

            MINTER: Yes, we have discussed him many times; he loved him. Marshall
                  Neilan loved Mr Taylor.

            DORAN: Did he ever bring any tales to you for which Taylor was supposed to have been
               responsible!

            MINTER: Not until recently.

            DORAN: When was that?

            MINTER: Last Friday night; whereupon we had a severe quarrel. I didn't
               believe him.

            DORAN: Friday night
               after the killing?

            MINTER: Yes.

            DORAN: Or before the killing?

            MINTER: No; after.

            DORAN: Did he ever say anything like that to you before the
                  killing?

            MINTER: No, indeed he did not; he knew that I loved Mr Taylor
               and he had known it.

            DORAN: Did he ever comment on that relation between you and
                  Taylor?

            MINTER: No, he did not; I wouldn't have permitted him to; and I didn't comment on
               his.

            DORAN: I will use the word "quarrel," but that may be exaggerated; did you ever
               quarrel with Neilan over Taylor? 
            MINTER: Absolutely not; absolutely not. Marshall is the
               typification of the happy-go-lucky Irish spirit and tempera­ment. He does perfectly
               terrible things to everybody, but everybody loves him. They are always glad to see
               him again. As to harboring any deep-seated malice, I don't believe he is capable of
               it. 
            DORAN: Could he have assumed at any time you and he, you and Marshall Neilan -- I am
               speaking of Marshall Neilan now -- Could he have assumed at any time that he might be
               or was engaged to you by reason of your relations wtth him? 
            MINTER: Could Marshall Neilan have assumed that Mr Taylor and I were engaged?

            DORAN: No, no; that you and Marshall Neilan were enqaged?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Did you ever give him the impression that he might some day be successful in
               his effort to marry you?

            MINTER: Not in my own knowledge. If I have, it was more or less of a joking way. I
               think I have at times said, "Well, Marshall, when are we going all around the world
               on our honey-moon?" exactly in the same manner as I took him to say, "Now, when you
               are my wedded bride we will do" so-and­-so. Marshall has done that time after time. 
            DORAN: Might he not have taken you seriously? 

            MINTER: I don't think so.

            DORAN: Do you know he did not?

            MINTER: No, I don't know that he did not.

            DORAN: Don't you know that he was really -- Don't you feel that he was really in love
               with you?

            MINTER: I can't truthfully answer "Yes" or "no" to that, beoause I don't know; I am
               not sure enough of Mr Neilan's nature. While I have known him a great many years,
               well, I will say I have known him several years, he is the type who flits back and
               forth, you know. - When you really think you know him he turns to something else, and
               I don't know, so I have never permitted myself to form any conclusions on his
               character; I don't know whether he has ever taken me seriously or not. I always
               treated him more or less in a joking manner.
