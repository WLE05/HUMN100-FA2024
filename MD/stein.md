            MISS J. M. BERGER Income Tax Expert for Taylor and M.M. Minter Statement taken
               3-11-26 at 1:30 PM 
            POLICE: We have been informed that you had a conversation with Mrs.
                  Shelby at the time he (Taylor) was killed in which
               you were the first that gave her the information as to his death. 

            BERGER: I did! My god, the next thing they will say I murdered him. I should say not.
               I was the first one to give it to her? Absolutely not. I didn't know it until it was
               given to me. I think Mrs. Shelby called me up right after I got
               to my office in the morning.

             POLICE: What time was that?

             BERGER: I imagine about 7:30. 

             POLICE: Do you recall that you warned Mrs. Shelby that she
               should not be in that house (N. Hampshire house) by
               herself?

             BERGER: I did? Well, I should say not.

             POLICE: And that she replied over the phone that she wasn't alone, that she had
                  Mr. Smith there?

             BERGER: I say that? How could I ever make such a remark? The first time I heard or
               saw you was after this murder, wasn't it?

            POLICE: Do you remember of ever calling Mrs. S helby on the
               telephone and telling her Taylor was killed or murdered?

            BERGER: NO - capital letters - NO.

             POLICE: Now, Miss Berger, I asked you yesterday a question,
               whether or not you ever had a conversation with Mrs. Shelby on
               the morning of February 2, 1922, following the death of Mr.
                  Taylor? 
             BERGER: I did. 
             POLICE: At what time?

            BERGER: At half past seven in the morning Mrs.
                  Shelby called me.

            POLICE: Wou1d you care to relate to me what the conversation was?

            BERGER: Absolutely. Gladly. I arrived at my office
               between 7 and 7:30 on the morning of February 2nd, 1922. My
               telephone was ringing. I answered the phone. Mrs. Charlotte
                  Shelby said, "Margery, I have something terrible
               to tell you. The man that was in your office
               yesterday afternoon is no more. He is dead." I said, "What do you mean?"
               She said, "He was found dead this morning." "Who told you? What do you
               know about it?" I said. "Lasky's just called me up and told me."
               I said, "Where are you now?" She said, "I am at the New Hampshire
                  home". I said, "Is the whole family there?" She said, "No, I am
               alone." She did state that  >Lasky's Studio  had called her up
               and informed her about half an hour previous to her calling me. It was
               between 7 and 7:30 that morning at my office that
               she called. 


             HARRY FELLOWS, Assistant Director to Wm. Desmond Taylor Statement taken 2-9-22.

             POLICE: Did she appear to be fond of him?

            FELLOWS: Miss Minter?

            POLICE: Yes.

            FELLOWS: Yes, she did seem to be very fond of Mr. Taylor. - - -
               and seemed to chase him around to the studio and things like that. As far as I
                  know Mr. Taylor never really thought an awful lot of
                  Miss Minter. I mean more than just to like her for a nice
               little girl. He thought more of Miss Normand than he did of any
               one I have ever known. I got there I must have got at Mr.
                  Taylor‚ house about 8 o'clock in the morning when I
               came there.

            POLICE: That is the day he was killed?

            FELLOWS: Yes, on Thursday morning.

             POLICE: Well, did you know that he was killed before you went there?

            FELLOWS: No, my brother called me up and told me Mr. Taylor was
               found dead. I understood him to say Mr. Taylor was found dead in
               bed.

            POLICE: Who was there, Harry, when you came in?

             FELLOWS: There was Douglas MacLean and the owner of the court I
               think, his name is Jesserun. I think there was two men from
               headquarters and my brother, Howard and Henry
                  Peavey. I am not positive whether the doctor was
               there when I first got there or whether he came when I was phoning Mr.
                  Eyton. Arthur Hoyt and Charlie
                  Maigne and myself went upstairs and got all the
               literature and things like that that we could get and put them in a package *** and I
               gave Jimmie Vantrees who was Mr. Taylor's
                  Cameraman and Mrs. Ivers (Jimmie's mother) and ask
               them to keep the letters for me. Why Jimmie must have given them
               to Mrs. Ivers and then then I went right over and got them from
               her and took them out to the studio.

            POLICE: What did you do with them?

             FELLOWS: Gave them to Mr. Eyton. *** I don‚Äôt think any body
               made an examination until Mr. Eyton insisted on an examination
               being made and that must have been two hours or 2¬Ω hours after the time
               we got there anyway.

 
             HOWARD FELLOWS, Chauffeur for Mr. Taylor Statement taken 2-9-22, 4:45 P.M.

            POLICE: Where did you take Mr. Taylor the day he was killed
               begin in the morning?

             FELLOWS: It was the studio. ...called for him I think at one o'clock. I took him
               down town to the bank, which I drove Harry up to see you, I
               think it was, which I went home and called for him at quarter of four at
               Robinson's.

             POLICE: Robinson's Store? 

            FELLOWS: Yes. He came along ‚Äî Harry was waiting to see him.
               They talked there until it was pretty near time for me to move or get a ticket for
               standing after hours. (After relating taking Mr. Taylor home,
               he, Taylor said) "I will call you between 7 and 7:30
               if I want you.

            POLICE: You went around to Mr. Taylor's
               house the night he was killed.

            FELLOWS: Yes.

            POLICE: Just describe your movements when you went there giving the time?

             FELLOWS: I called up at the house at 5 minutes after
                  8 which I looked at my watch * * I called up and got no answer. About
                  5 minutes after 8 I tried to call and I went out and got into the
               car, drove up 6th to Alvarado, up
                  Alvarado to Maryland and right
               around in back there where his garage is, right behind the landlord's
                  house * * * I didn't put the car away then, I left the engine running
               and lights on.** I rang the door bell, the lights were all lit which I thought he
               might be home on account of all the lights being lit. I rang
               the door bell and the second time I rang the door bell I looked at my watch ***,
               which my watch says quarter after 8. I rung the door bell 4 or 5 times
               because I kind of thought he was in there on account of thoughts being lit.

            POLICE: Could you hear the door bell ringing?

             FELLOWS: Yes. I started away and I got about to the steps and I hesitated to see if
               I could hear him coming. As I hesitated there was no sound and I went and put the car
               away, opened the garage doors and put the car away, closed the door and walked right
               straight through the court down Alvarado.

             POLICE: You did not open the screen door?

            FELLOWS: No, never do open any door.

            POLICE: Did you ever have such occasion before, the lights would be on and he would
               not answer the door bell?

             FELLOWS: I never had any occasions like that. *** as I go around I notice there is a
               light lit in his bedroom and a light lit in his
                  den. There is always them lights but it was a dim light.
               This time all the lights were lit, dining room lights were lit and they lit up the
               certains that much more.

            POLICE: His upstairs lights were lit?

            FELLOWS: One of them, just a glance I took at them.


             WILLIAM DAVIS, Chauffeur for Mabel Normand Statement taken 2-10-22 POLICE: About how
               long did you wait? (Speaking of the night of the murder) 
             DAVIS: Well, something -- 30 or 35 minutes; just an estimate.

             POLICE: About what time did you arrive?

             DAVIS: About 7 o'clock.

             POLICE: About what time was it when you drove away from there? 

             DAVIS: It was around‚Äî it was between twenty and a quarter of eight;
               it was within five minutes of that because I looked at the clock and it
               showed about twenty minutes of eight. 

             CHAUNCEY EATON Chauffeur for Mrs Shelby Taken 6-1-36, at 4:30 PM
            POLICE: He was murdered on the night of February 1st, 1922. "When did you first hear
               of the minder.

            EATON: If I am not mistaken, when I went to the New Hampshire house the next morning
               about 8 o'clock.

             POLICE: Who told you about Taylor being murdered?

             EATON: I think Mrs. Shelby called to me from an upstairs window
               and said, "Did you know that Taylor had been murdered?

             POLICE: Can you fix the exact time of the morning?

             EATON: Not otherwise, about 8 o'clock. (Witness is speaking about taking the gun
                from M.M. Minter at the time of her attempted suicide)

             POLICE: Can you describe the gun which you unloaded which belonged to
                  Mary?

             EATON: I think a 25 caliber blue automatic. I believe we could find the shells of
               that gun because I hid them on a beam in the New Hampshire house.
