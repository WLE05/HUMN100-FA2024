               Interviews with Ethel Mae Harrison
               
              February 13, 1922
              NEW YORK HERALD 
           
            ...Mrs. Robins, who married William Cunningham Deane-Tanner, or William
               Desmond Taylor, as he was later known, in 1902, said her former husband had
               spent some time on a pony ranch in southwestern Kansas before she met him in
               New York.  The only information she had ever had was that which Deane-Tanner
               gave her personally.
            
            "Mr. Deane-Tanner told me that when he arrived here from Ireland he had
               gone out to this ranch," Mrs. Robins said, "and his family in Ireland had
               bought for him a part interest in it.  When I met him he referred to it and
               told me a flaw in the title had forced several of the shareholders,
               including himself, to give up their part, and he then joined the Davenport
               road company.  After the failure of his venture in Kansas he returned to his
               home in Ireland for a visit.
            
            "With reference to the claim of this Mr. Taylor in California that he
               is the son of the murdered director, I would not like to say flatly that the
               claim is or is not true, for I knew little of Mr. Deane-Tanner's life on the
               ranch in Kansas and did not find it necessary to catechize him minutely, and
               he never mentioned anything to me about having been married out there.
               Perhaps there is some truth in the story, or it may be another of the many
               persons who come forward whenever there is an estate to be settled.  I have
               been interested in the number of persons who claim Mr. Deane-Tanner, or
                  Taylor, was their father.  To date he must have had at least six or seven
                  children besides my own daughter, if the stories are all correct.  As Mr.
               Deane-Tanner would only be about fifty years old now, that is rather
               ridiculous, I think."
             
             Referring to the criminal end of the case, Mrs. Robins criticized the
               work of the Los Angeles detectives and prosecutors, saying they do not seem
               to be particularly anxious to solve the mystery of the identity of the
               murderer.
               
            "I have bitterly resented the accounts printed in some of the
               newspapers here that my daughter and myself are merely interested in the
               financial part of the affair and are more interested in the Taylor estate
               than in the identity of the person who killed my former husband.  This is
               absolutely untrue, for, as Mr. Taylor's former wife, I am deeply grieved at
               this terrible affair and am anxious to see the guilty person punished."
               Returning to the discussion of the claim of the man who says the movie
               director was his father, Mrs. Robins said that it seemed improbable that her
               first husband ever used the name of Taylor before he left New York in 1908.
               She said that to old friends who knew him when he first came to this country
               and had been in constant touch with him during his stay in Kansas nothing
               was known of any marriage while he was in the West.  After that, and until
               he disappeared, Mrs. Robins said, he never used the name of Taylor, or
               referred extensively to his visit to the ranch in the West.
            
            "I never really knew Mr. Deane-Tanner's right age," Mrs. Robins said,
               "and I understood that he had been in his country about eight or nine years,
               when I married him at the Little Church Around the Corner in 1901.  He was a
               fine, lovable man, and I never had occasion to closely question him about
               his 'past,' which every one seems trying to dig up."
              
            No decision whether Mrs. Robins or her daughter, Ethel, will go to
               California in connection with the settling of the estate has been reached.
               Frank E. Schrenseisen of New Rochelle, attorney for Miss Tanner, said that
               he was awaiting developments and instructions from the office of the Public
               Administrator in Los Angeles.  Another attorney for Miss Tanner has been
               engaged in Los Angeles.  Should the Public Administrator place credence in
                  the story of Taylor, it is probable that Miss Tanner will accompany her
               attorney to the coast.
           
             "Mr. Deane-Tanner told my daughter that he had made a will in her
               favor," Mrs. Robins said, "and had placed it in his safe deposit box.  I
               understand that this is another one of the items which the police say have
               strangely 'disappeared.'  What he did with it I have no idea, but I feel
               that the entire matter will be straightened out.  Just at present I am
               hoping that the murderer of Mr. Taylor will be brought to justice for this
               terrible crime."
              
            Mrs. Robins commented on the strange disappearance of Dennis Deane-
               Tanner, brother of the murdered director, and said she had never heard a
               word from him since he left this city in 1912, just four years after her
               husband disappeared.  She said the two brothers had been good friends and
               business associates, and that Dennis had visited their home at Larchmont on
               several occasions, and had met many of their friends.  There was never any
               trouble between the brothers as far as she knew, Mrs. Robins said.
            
               February 14, 1922
               NEW YORK AMERICAN
              
            To the two names suggested in the New York American yesterday--Edward
               F. Sands and Dennis Gage Deane-Tanner as persons whose discovery may furnish
               a clue to the identity of the slayer of William Desmond Taylor--was added
               yesterday a third.
             
             The third person is a woman, a fascinating blonde who was the companion
               of Taylor (or W. C. Deane-Tanner, as he was then known) on a trip through
               the Adirondacks during the Summer of 1908, three months prior to the sudden
               disappearance of "Pete" Tanner in late October, 1908.
              
            This woman, who had completely enchained the fancy of the aristocratic,
               handsome Tanner, was married.  Her identity is said to be known to a few of
               Tanner's associates of the old days when he was a director in the A. J.
               Crawford Company firm at No. 253 Fifth avenue.  She was the co-respondent in
               the divorce suit instituted some two years after "Pete" Tanner's
               disappearance by Mrs. Ethel May Hamilton Robins, now the wife of Edward L.
               C. Robins, managing proprietor of Delmonico's.
              
            Does this hitherto hidden episode in the life of the murdered man bear
               any significance upon the crime?
               
            Was the woman's husband implacably determined to avenge himself upon
               the man who had won the affections of his wife?
              
            Was it the hand of the husband that fired the fatal bullet (from twelve
               to fourteen years old, according to the testimony of experts in ballistics)
               that killed William Desmond Taylor?
              
             ...At her home, Orienta Point, Mamaroneck, Mrs. Robins, former wife of
               the slain director, yesterday refused to discuss this episode in the life of
               her former husband.  She refused to see newspaper men but told a friend:
               "I would do anything in my power to solve the mystery of Mr. Tanner's
               death but I do not think there can be any possible relation between this
               incident and the crime.  It was not until long after Mr. Tanner's
               disappearance that I learned definitely there was another woman in his life.
               "This information was placed in the hands of my attorney, Mr. George
               Thoms, and he brought a successful suit for divorce against Mr. Tanner.
               This was in the latter part of 1918 [sic].  At that time I did not know
               whether Mr. Tanner was dead or alive.
             
            "It was later, perhaps seven years ago, that I saw Mr. Tanner for the
               first time on the screen.  I cannot remember the name of the photoplay in
               which he appeared.  However, it was not until two and one-half years ago
               that I learned definitely that William Desmond Taylor was my former
               husband."
              
               February 14, 1922
               WASHINGTON TIMES
              
             New York, Feb. 14 -- Of the many screen stars he knew, some of whom
               have been thrown squarely into the spotlight by the unrelenting inquiry into
               his association with William Desmond Taylor, slain director, mentioned but
               one--Mary Miles Minter--in his letters to his nineteen-year-old daughter,
               Miss Ethel Daisy Deane-Tanner.
              
             Disclosing this fact to a reporter today, Miss Tanner and her mother,
               Mrs. Edward L. C. Robins, who live in Mamaroneck, both of whom were deserted
               by the man of mystery in 1908, said that Miss Minter's name was used by the
               director only in an impersonal way.
               
            He referred to her as an actress of ability, and said he had directed
               her in some of her photoplays.  This was one of the last letters written to
               his daughter by Taylor before he was murdered in his Los Angeles bungalow.
               Mrs. Robins and her daughter expressly asserted that the name of Mabel
               Normand, screen comedienne, and last person to see the director alive, did
               not appear in Taylor's letters to his daughter, which had been more or less
               frequent during the last two years.
               
            Curiously enough, (and one reason why Mrs. Robins is increasingly
               inclined to the opinion that her husband's sudden disappearance from New
               York was due to loss of memory), her former husband never mentioned her in
               the letters.
              
            Another reason for this belief, she declared, was that on the times she
               and her daughter lunched here with Taylor--after it was definitely
               established that Taylor was in reality Deane-Tanner--he never mentioned the
               fact that he deserted his wife and daughter.  On these occasions all three
               felt the subject was rather delicate and it was never brought up.
               Mrs. Robins said that when she and her daughter became convinced two
               years ago, after seeing pictures of Taylor, that he was the girl's father,
               Miss Deane-Tanner took the initiative and wrote to him.  His reply came
               immediately.
            
            In it he said he was very glad to hear from her; that he had not heard
               from he for so long that he thought she was dead.  This is one more reason
               why Mrs. Robins believes her former husband was a victim of aphasia when he
               left, after attending the Vanderbilt cup races in 1908.
               Taylor also, Mrs. Robins asserted, was unable to recall friends of
               their married life, and when their names were mentioned, his face failed to
               show the slightest signs of remembrance.  He did remember, however, favorite
               dishes of his former wife when he was dining with his daughter, pointing
               them out to the latter on the menu during their luncheon together.
               Mrs. Robins declared that these points proved that his mind, while
               vague as to consequential facts about her married life with the director,
               retained minor details.
             
             The director's experiences in Alaska also were set forth in one letter.
               Taylor told of how he contracted scurvy, consequently suffering from loss of
               hair, headaches and neuralgia.  Another letter dismissed with a few scornful
               words Sands, his chauffeur, who is still being sought by police.  The
               director declared Sands had upset his home and said his name had been forged
               to checks by his unfaithful servant.
              
            Signatures Taylor used in his letters to his daughter, for whom he
               showed deep devotion, were "Father" and "Daddy Pete."  The origin of how
               Taylor came to be known as "Pete" was explained by Mrs. Robins.  She said
               when Taylor, or as he was known then, Deane-Tanner, first came to live in
               New York he took lodging with several Englishmen.
             
               Taylor, always deliberate and calculating in his methods, was nicknamed
               "P. D. Q.," by his roommates, which was quickly shortened to "Pete."
               The director's promise to leave his estate to his daughter was
               contained in a letter written in February, 1920.  Mrs. Robins said her
               former husband said in this message he thought it would be good policy to
               leave them both an annuity, in addition to telling of his will bequeathing
               his estate to Ethel Daisy.
              
               February 7, 1922
               NEW YORK AMERICAN
             
             [relating the testimony of Taylor's wife during the divorce hearing in
               1911]...Mrs. Tanner, in her testimony, said she was married on
               December 7, 1901, at the Little Church Around the Corner.
               The ceremony was performed by Rev. George C. Houghton, pastor of the
               church.  Following the marriage the couple went to live at No. 40 Washington
               Square South, and later moved to the Hotel Colonial at Columbus Avenue and
               Eighty-first street, at which time her husband became associated with A. J.
               Crawford & Co., at No. 251 Fifth Avenue.
               Mrs. Deane-Tanner added:
             
            "My husband left home at noon on October 23, 1908, and I have never
               seen him since.  The last word received from him was on October 26, 1908,
               when he was stopping at the Broadway Central Hotel.  He sent word to the
               Crawford firm asking for a sum of money.  This was sent to him by Daniel J.
               Barker, of the firm.  Then he disappeared."
