               ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Section 1] </p>

            <p>PRESENT: <persName ref="doran">Mr. W.C. Doran,</persName> Deputy District Attorney,
                  <persName ref="minter">Miss Mary Miles Minter,</persName>
               <persName ref="mott">John G. Mott,</persName> attorney for Miss Minter, and <persName

            <p>STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER</p>

            <p>Questions by <persName ref="doran">Mr. Doran</persName>: </p>

            <p> DORAN: How long have you known <persName ref="taylor">Mr taylor</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Since <date when="1919-07">July of 1919</date> -- yes, that is correct. </p>

            <p> DORAN: He has been your director in pictures, has he? </p>

            <p> MINTER: Yes we commenced this <orgName type="company">company</orgName> together. </p>

            <p> DORAN: Did you have occasion to call on him at <placeName type="residence">his
                  residence</placeName> within <date type="month"> the last thirty days</date> prior
               to his death? -- approximately <date type="month"> thirty days?</date>
            </p>

            <p> MINTER: Just a moment, will you --</p>

            <p> DORAN: Let me change the question. When was the last time you called on him at
                  <placeName type="taylorshouse">his residence</placeName>? </p>

            <p> MINTER: On the <date type="murderday">23rd of December.</date>
            </p>
            <p>DORAN: Were you alone at that time or did others accompany you to see him? </p>

            <p> MINTER: I was alone. </p>

            <p> DORAN: Was any one else there?</p>

            <p>MINTER: no, not a soul. </p>

            <p>DORAN: Was <persName ref="Sands">his valet</persName>, the colored man, there, do you
               know?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Not that I know of. </p>

            <p> DORAN: Prior to that time, was it your habit to call on him at his residence or had
               it been your habit?</p>

            <p>MINTER: I couldn't call it a habit, but <date type="severaloccasions">on several
                  occasions</date> I did call upon him, though never asÂ·1ate as upon this
               occasion.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Now, on this last occasion, whet time of the day or night was it that you
               called? </p>

            <p>MINTER: May l tell this in my own way? </p>

            <p>DORAN: Yes, I would rather have you tell it in your own way, if you will.</p>

            <p> MINTER: I am glad to. I am trying to answer as I would in court and 1 don't like to
               do so. </p>

            <p> DORAN: Just proceed, go ahead and tell it in your own way.</p>

            <p>MINTER: I had gone to <objectName type="furniture">bed</objectName>; I hadn't seen
                  <persName ref="taylor">Mr taylor</persName> in <date type="fivemonthsago">five
                  months</date> at the time -- <date>three months,</date> I know; three months, and
               I just got to thinking about it and I decided I couldn't stand it any longer. I was
               going to go up and tell him "goodbye. I got up and dressed, went down to my
                  <placeName type="house">grandmother's room</placeName> and I said, <persName
                  ref="cshelby">"Mama,</persName> I am going over to say 'goodbye' to Mr taylor,"
               and she advised me not to do it. She said it was too late: "Do you know it is nearly
                  <time type="12oclock">twelve o'clock?</time>" she said. I said, "Yes, sure, but I
               just must do so," I said, "I realize that this is not the usual thing and I have
               never been there so late, but I must do so, Mama. I am going to give him a
                  <objectName type="letter">letter</objectName> in whioh I have told him 'goodbye,"'
               She said, "All right, then, if you must. I would get up and go with you, but I don't
               feel well enough," Mama often accompanied me on <eventName type="Mary'strips">my
                  trips</eventName>, which were not very many during the entire time that i knew
               him. So I went over there and arrived at <time type="11:55">five minutes to
                  twelve</time>, I am strange about that, I am rather queer about that, I think of
               the time; every time I was with him I would say, "Well, this time yesterday I didn't
               see him and today I am with him," and things like that. So I <time>arrived at five
                  minutes to twelve</time> and left at t<time type="12:40">twenty minutes to
                  one</time>, and-- Do you wish me to tell you all that transpired? </p>
            <p> DORAN: Never mind about that. </p>

            <p> DORAN: Your <persName ref="grandmother">grandmother</persName> didn't accompany
               you?</p>

            <p> MINTER: No, she did not. </p>

            <p>DORAN: Your <persName ref="chaffeur">chauffeur</persName> drove you there? </p>

            <p>MINTER: No, I drove myself in my little <objectName type="car">car</objectName>,
               little run-about.</p>

            <p> DORAN: That was <date type="Dec23rd">December 23d</date>? </p>

            <p> MINTER: Yes,<date> December 23rd.</date></p>

            <p> DORAN: When was the last time you saw him prior to that? </p>

            <p> MINTER: I couldn't give you the exact date, but I know it was at <date>least three
                  months and a little over; it was over three months.</date></p>

            <p>DORAN: During the three months prior to December 23d, did you ever meet him
               anywhere.</p>

            <p> MINTER: No. You mean casually or see him really to talk to? I saw him, yes. </p>

            <p>DORAN: See him and meet him, to be with him? </p>
            <p>MINTER: No; no, indeed. I passed him at <placeName type="studio"> Lasky Studio
               </placeName> when I go over there. Sometimes I have seen <objectName type="vehicle"
                  >his car</objectName> go down <placeName type="street"> Western
                  Avenue,</placeName> but I hadn't seen him to speak to in <date
                  type="threemonthsago">three months</date>.</p>

            <p> DORAN: As I understand it, you were sincerely in love with him?</p>

            <p> MINTER: That is true.</p>

            <p> DORAN: Did you convey that feeling to him?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Absolutely.</p>

            <p> DORAN: You told him, did you?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Absolutely. He loved me; he told me so.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Were you engaged to be married?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No, we were not.</p>

            <p> DORAN: <eventName type="timeofdeath">At the time of his death</eventName>, it was
               --</p>

            <p> MR. MOTT: Right there at that point you might explain about the rising sun, with
               reference to your engagement. I think that explains the attitude between both of you. </p>

            <p>MINTER: I don't know just which to do, whether to tell you this whole thing, go right
               along and talk. I can easily do that. </p>

            <p>MR. MOTT: He asked if you were engaged to him. Tell him about the "rising sun"
               explanation. </p>

            <p> MINTER: I can tell you the whole thing better without being asked.</p>

            <p> MR. DORAN: Yes. Go ahead. and tell us in your own way all about it.</p>

            <p> MINTER: I had always known that this was just<eventName> an exquisite chapter in my
                  life</eventName> that must necessarily be a brief one: I couldn't bear to part
               with it; it was just a beautiful thing that seldom occurs in the. world today as I
               see it, as it is forced upon me. It as simply a beautiful white flame; I met
                  <persName ref="taylor">him</persName>; I had always been a <persName>reserved,
                  very retiring young girl</persName>, and he was the first man and the only man who
               ever embodied all the glories of manhood in one private body. He represented that to
               me. He never by look, by word or by deed gave me any reason to doubt any of my ideals
               that were placed in him absolutely. At the time our love first formulated he said to
               me, "Mary, this is not right. You are May and I am December, and this is not right. I
               know it is best that we must part." This was at the very beginning of it, and I said,
               "Of course, I don't want to do any immodest or bold thing; I couldn't try to withhold
               a person's love for me who didn't care for me."" I said, "I know that you are many
               years older than I, but I couldn't love anybody as I love you. I simply love you. And
               we did try to part, We tried it again and again, and then he would beoome ill. At one
               time I had almost resolved to see him no more, and he was taken ill and nobody else
               cared, [page 6] really cared whether he ate his <objectName>dinner</objectName> or
               whether he dressed warm1y enough, whether he took care of himself, and I couldn't
               bear for him to suffer. It was not only a love of sweetheart, but I wanted to be his
               nurse. I wanted to hold his head when it was aching. I wanted him to tell me his
               mental troubles, his heart troubles, and let me soothe them away for him as I would
               for a little child. I forgot the man's age; it meant nothing to me. The only thing I
               wanted was to serve him as I would have served the Lord or a little child, and then
               it just passed away; for months at a time I wouldn't see him and I didn't know why.
               Finally, I decided there was no use; it must come to an end and I went there on the
               night of the 23d to give him this letter telling him "goodbye." I had reason to
               believe, in the awful vernacular of the day, that it was over anyway, but I went
               there to say "goodbye" myself. He said, "It is rather late, isn't it, Mary?" when he
               opened the door. I said, "Yes, but don't you realize that I had to come to see you?
               You know Mama has been sick for three months and you have been ill and I have been
               frightfully worried and you haven't even had the kindness to call me to tell me that
               you were i11 and that I must not expect to see you to tell mo that things are all
               right." </p>

            <p> I said, "I don't care if you don't wish to see me, because it hurts me, but it
               wouldn't have hurt one-millionth as much if you had just explained to me and not
               leave me in the dark." He said, "Mary, I couldn't help it; I couldn't help it and I
               can't explain it to you." Oh, I don't know! I have told this thing so many times, Mr
               Doran, that the words just - I can't tell it even as it is; I can't even express it
               to you as it really is. There is so much more to it.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>MR DORAN: At that time, on <date type="Dec23rd">December 23d,</date> let's see, he
               was killed on <date ref="Feb1st">February 1st</date>. Who was directing you then? </p>
            <p>MINTER: Why, no one was. I had finished a picture.</p>

            <p> DORAN: Who directed the last one?</p>

            <p>STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT
               ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Section 2]</p>

            <p>MINTER: My last director was <persName ref="urson">Frank Urson</persName>. <persName
                  ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> so often, often made the remark to me that he
               wished tbat he were younger; he wanted to be younger. We undoubtedly would have been
               married today bnd he been younger. <persName ref="taylor">He</persName> explained our
               not. being engaged in that way. I knew we never could be married; I also knew I never
               would love for another human being in the way I cared for him. So he would say, "You
               know, <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName>, to me you are the morning sun, bright,
               beaut1ful, and with the world and a futune before you, and I am the setting sun, and
               don't you see, my dear, it simply cannot be. I hope tbat doesn't give you the
               impression that I begged him to marry me. I never did in my life. I couldn't do that.
               I never even called him <persName ref="taylor">"Billie"</persName> in my life. The
               man was too wonderful for that. He was wonderful. I don't care what anybody says or
               what they prove against him. I knew him as the finest thing in the world. </p>

            <p> MR MOTT: <persName ref="taylor">He</persName> as the embodyment of your ideal? </p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes, and I can aay now that I can't truthfully -- I don't know any of those
               ugly things which have been aaid about him. I never found him so. He was glorious to
               me. </p>

            <p> MR DORAN: I read in the <objectName type="document">paper</objectName> where you had
               been <eventName type="major">engaged</eventName> to some other man.</p>

            <p>MINTER: To <persName ref="dickson">Mr Dickson</persName>. That is not entirely
               true.</p>

            <p>DORAN: What is his first name?</p>

            <p> MINTER: <persName ref="dickson">Thomas Dickson</persName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Someone besides him, a director in the movies.</p>

            <p>MINTER: <persName ref="neilan">Marshall Neilan</persName>, <eventName type="major"
                  >engaged</eventName> to him?</p>

            <p>DORAN: Yes, <persName ref="neilan">Marshall Neilan</persName>. Didn't I read in the
                  <objectName type="document">papers</objectName> that you had been engaged to him
               and the <eventName type="major">engagement</eventName> had been broken off? </p>

            <p>MINTER: That is not true. <persName ref="dickson">Mr Dickson</persName> is the only
               one to whom I have been even remotely engaged, and that was a freak of
               despondency.</p>

            <p>DORAN: What about <persName ref="neilan">Marshall Neilan</persName>? Were you engaged
               to him?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Had you been going with <persName ref="neilan">Marshall Neilan</persName>
               during, say the last <date>thirty or sixty days prior</date> to <persName
                  ref="taylor">Taylor's</persName> death?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Going with <persName ref="taylor">him</persName>?</p>

            <p>DORAN: Had you been out anywhere with <persName ref="taylor">him</persName>? </p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes; he had been to see me; I had been out with <persName ref="taylor"
                  >him</persName>; I am not sure whether it was within the <date>thirty days</date>
               or not, but in the <date>last two months</date>, yes sir; but going with him no more
               than I had for years off and on. <persName ref="neilan">Mr Neilan's</persName> traits
               [page 9] are well known; he comes to see you, and we are always glad to receive him,
               but we never know how long he is going to stay with us or how long he was going to
               stay with this one or that one. He flits here and there like a swallow. We are all
               charmed with his personality, but don't take him seriously. </p>
            <p>DORAN: Has <persName ref="taylor">he</persName> proposed to you?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Must I answer that? Yes, he did.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Do you recall approximately when it was?</p>

            <p>MINTER: About <date>two months ago</date>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: That would take it to <date>December 1st</date>, approximately or in the
               middle of December?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Well, I think it was after that, Yes -- No, let me see, <date>December
                  1st</date> -- I wish I could tell you.</p>

            <p>DORAN: With reference to this <date>December 23d</date> that you called on <persName
                  ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>, when was it?</p>

            <p>MINTER: It as before the <date>1st of December</date>, I think.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Q. Before the <date>1st of December</date>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes; about the <date>last of November</date>. </p>

            <p>DORAN: And you, of course, rejected im, I suppose?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes; that is, I didn't exactly say, "No, I will not marry you." I didn't take
               him seriously. I joked with <persName ref="taylor">him</persName> at the time.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did <persName ref="taylor">he</persName> seem to be serious?</p>

            <p>MINTER: You never know. I couldn't say whether ee was serious or not. I thought
               possibly he was joking, or had a few <objectName type="consumable"
                  >cocktails</objectName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: How many times after that did <persName ref="taylor">he</persName> mention the
               subject to you?</p>

            <p>MINTER: He didn't mention the subject. "May I marry you" again; he didn't say that,
               but he has been on very friendly terms with me and then suddenly go away to
                  <placeName type="city">San Francisco</placeName>. and I wouldn't hear from him and
               I would remark, "Isn't that just like <persName ref="neilan">Marshall?</persName>"
               and thought no more of it. </p>
            <p>DORAN: Well, but along toward the last <date>thirty days</date> prior to <persName
                  ref="taylor">Taylor's</persName>
               <eventName type="major">death</eventName>, he seemed to be quite devoted to you, did
                  <persName ref="taylor">he</persName> not?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No; I can't really say that he did. As for being with him, wasn't with
                  <persName ref="taylor">him</persName> very much.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Didn't you observe in him some jealousy?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Oh, no; No, I can't say that. He was not jealous of me. He is the least
               jealous man I ever met. He takes life too much -- </p>
            <p>DORAN: Did <persName ref="taylor">he</persName> ever say anything to you about
                  <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes, we have discussed him many times; he loved him. <persName ref="neilan"
                  >Marshall Neilan</persName> loved <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did he ever bring any tales to you for which <persName ref="taylor"
                  >Taylor</persName> was supposed to have been responsible!</p>

            <p>MINTER: Not until recently.</p>

            <p>DORAN: When was that?</p>

            <p>MINTER: <date>Last Friday night</date>; whereupon we had a severe quarrel. I didn't
               believe him.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <date>Friday night</date>
               <time>after</time> the <eventName type="major">killing</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Or <time>before</time> the <eventName type="major">killing</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No; after.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did he ever say anything like that to you <time>before</time> the <eventName
                  type="major">killing</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No, indeed he did not; he knew that I loved <persName ref="taylor">Mr
                  Taylor</persName> and he had known it.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did he ever comment on that relation between you and <persName ref="taylor"
                  >Taylor</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No, <persName ref="taylor">he</persName> did not; I wouldn't have permitted
               him to; and I didn't comment on his.</p>

            <p>DORAN: I will use the word "quarrel," but that may be exaggerated; did you ever
                  <eventName type="fight">quarrel</eventName> with <persName ref="neilan"
                  >Neilan</persName> over <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>? </p>
            <p>MINTER: Absolutely not; absolutely not. <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName> is
               the typification of the happy-go-lucky Irish spirit and temperaÂ­ment. <persName
                  ref="taylor">He</persName> does perfectly terrible things to everybody, but
               everybody loves him. They are always glad to see him again. As to harboring any
               deep-seated malice, I don't believe <persName ref="taylor">he</persName> is capable
               of it. </p>
            <p>DORAN: Could he have assumed at any time you and <persName ref="taylor"
               >he</persName>, you and <persName ref="neilan">Marshall Neilan</persName> -- I am
               speaking of <persName ref="neilan">Marshall Neilan</persName> now -- Could he have
               assumed at any time that <persName ref="taylor">he</persName> might be or was engaged
               to you by reason of your relations wtth him? </p>
            <p>MINTER: Could <persName ref="neilan">Marshall Neilan</persName> have assumed that
                  <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor</persName> and I were engaged?</p>

            <p>DORAN: No, no; that you and <persName ref="neilan">Marshall Neilan</persName> were
               enqaged?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did you ever give <persName ref="taylor">him</persName> the impression that he
               might some day be successful in his effort to marry you?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Not in my own knowledge. If I have, it was more or less of a joking way. I
               think I have at times said, "Well, <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName>, when
               are we going all around the world on our honey-moon?" exactly in the same manner as I
               took him to say, "Now, when you are my wedded bride we will do" so-andÂ­-so. <persName
                  ref="neilan">Marshall</persName> has done that time after time. </p>
            <p>DORAN: Might he not have taken you seriously? </p>

            <p>MINTER: I don't think so.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Do you know <persName ref="taylor">he</persName> did not?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No, I don't know that <persName ref="taylor">he</persName> did not.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Don't you know that <persName ref="taylor">he</persName> was really -- Don't
               you feel that <persName ref="taylor">he</persName> was really in love with you?</p>

            <p>MINTER: I can't truthfully answer "Yes" or "no" to that, beoause I don't know; I am
               not sure enough of <persName ref="neilan">Mr Neilan's</persName> nature. While I have
               known him a great many years, well, I will say I have known him <date>several
                  years</date>, he is the type who flits back and forth, you know. - When you really
               think you know him he turns to something else, and I don't know, so I have never
               permitted myself to form any conclusions on his character; I don't know whether he
               has ever taken me seriously or not. I always treated <persName ref="taylor"
                  >him</persName> more or less in a joking manner. </p>

            <byline>Lucy DiChristina</byline>
            <p> STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT
               ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Part 4] <persName
                  ref="Marshall">Marshall</persName> said that to me, and looked right at me. I
               could feel myself grow red. I said, "Is that all you have to tell me about <persName
                  ref="Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>?" He said, "Well, I could recite some more
               instances about <persName ref="Taylor">Bill's</persName> seeming insanity." He said,
               "I am certain he was insane. He stood up and told those things as <eventName
                  type="sober">soberly</eventName> as I am talking to you now." </p>
            <p> MR MOTT: Excuse me. Did he refer to <persName ref="Taylor">Mr Taylor's</persName>
               physical condition? </p>
            <p> MINTER: Yes, he said he was <eventName type="drunk">drunk</eventName> at the time.
                  <persName ref="Marshall">Marshall</persName> has told ma on several occasions,
               sometimes long ago and sometimes recently that he always hated to see <persName
                  ref="Taylor">Bill</persName> drink because he said, "You wouldn't know the man; he
               changes so; he gets maudlin and silly, smiles in a foolish manner and wobbles and
               talks, oh, just the silly, foolish things." He said, "None of his friends like to see
               him drink." At this time he was <eventName type="drunk">intoxicated</eventName> and
               he talked on and on and on about this thing." <persName ref="Marshall"
                  >Marshall</persName> said he got up and he told <persName ref="Taylor">
                  Bill</persName>, "You are insane; something 1s the matter with your mind. I would
               certainly take more vengeance on you if I didn't think you were crazy," and that was
               tbe opinion of <persName ref="Arthur">Arthur Hoyt</persName> and <persName
                  ref="Robinson">Cap Robinson</persName> and everybody. They were perfectly amazed
               that a man of <persName ref="Taylor">Mr Taylor's</persName> lovable, sweet,
               considerate, gentlemanly disposition all through life should suddenly turn around and
               say this about not only a woman, but about me, whom they all knew he admired and
               respected. </p>
            <p> When I heard of this thing, l just looked to <persName ref="Marshall"
                  >Marshall</persName> and said, "Is that all you have to tell me about <persName
                  ref="Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>?" And he said, "Yes, that is all. That 1s the
               ghastly thing. I know you are going to hear this from somebody and I wanted you to
               hear it from me, and want to find out what you knew about the <eventName
                  type="murder">murder</eventName> of this man." </p>
            <p> By this time I was getting -- Oh, how can I can I express it? -- just exhausted with
               shock, one shock after another and of all the shocks I had received, this coming from
               hlm who I had no reason to doubt his word, I couldn't believe it; not as I knew
                  <persName ref="Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>, I couldn't believe for an instant he
               had ever said these things to anybody, yet there <persName ref="Marshall"
                  >Marshall</persName> giving me names, dates and places. The thing was too much for
               me. I got furious; and I said, "I don't believe you! I think you are lying! How dare
               you say this about him to me! I never want to see you again?" He got up and walked
               around the room for a minute and I was just broiling; I was just furious; and he
               turned around and he said, "Well, <persName ref="Mary">Mary</persName>, some day you
               will realize that I certainly am not saying this for any personal reason. It hurts me
               as it must hurt you. I am simply telling you because you are bound to know it; it is
               the truth and I wanted to be the one to tell you. </p>
            <p> Well, I didn't have any more to say to him. I was just furious; I was furious with
               him; and finally he talked and he said, more, more, more personal things about, "You
               know <persName ref="Mary">Mary</persName> that I care for you." </p>
            <p> DORAN: He told you he loved you, did he? </p>
            <p>MINTER: Yes; he did on <date type="Friday">Friday</date> night. He said, "You know I
               care for you deeply." </p>
            <p> I said, "I don't care; I don't want you to care for me; I don't want <persName
                  ref="Jones">John Jones</persName> to care for me or anybody; I don't want ever to
               be in <eventName type="love">love</eventName> again as long as I <eventName
                  type="life">live</eventName>; I don't want to see any man; I hate men." I probably
               raved on. </p>
            <p> I dont know what more I can tell you. I was so tired, exhausted; I had been sitting
               up all <time type="night">night</time>. This conversation didn't come as quickly as I
               am te11ing it to you. It came with long pauses; he would get up and walk around with
               his <objectName type="cigarette">cigarette</objectName> smoking and come back again
               and go out and talk to the property man, go out of the <placeName>office</placeName>,
               and I would sit there alone and I tore a piece of paper, I was so tired, and
               suggested that we go <placeName type="home">home</placeName>. I said, "Why keep
               sitting up? </p>
            <p> You have got to get up at <time type="morning">eight o'clock</time> in the <time
                  type="morning">morning</time> and it is nearly <time type="morning">dawn</time>."
               He aaid, "I am worried about this thing; I want to find out what you know about this
                  <eventName type="murder">murder</eventName>." Then it developed that <persName
                  ref="Marshall">Marshall</persName> thought I knew something about it, and he
               looked at me and he said, "Now, <persName ref="Mary">Mary</persName>" -- he got a
               little profane, he said, "Now, <persName ref="Mary">Mary</persName>, for God's sake,
               if you know anything about the <eventName type="murder">murder</eventName> of
                  <persName ref="Taylor">Bill</persName> tell it to me now." He said, "Don't
               withhold anything." This was too much; not only had he been telling me these things
               about <persName ref="Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>, but there he sat evidently
               believing that I knew someth1ng. I said, "Do you think that I <eventName
                  type="murder">killed</eventName>
               <persName ref="Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>?" He said, "Oh, no; don't be silly. Now
               is no time to talk things like that. " He said, "I am just trying to find something
               out about this. This is going to be an awful <eventName type="affair"
                  >affair</eventName>." I said, "I didn't <eventName type="murder">kill</eventName>
               <persName ref="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName> and I don't know who
                  <eventName type="murder">murdered</eventName> him." He said, "You don't? You don't
               know anything?" He said, "Of course, you didn't <eventName type="murder"
                  >kill</eventName> him; of course, you didn't put anybody on to do it, But" he
               said, "don't you know somebody, don't you know some intiÂ­mate details that other
               people might not know? Can't you rack your brain and think who would have a motive
               for <eventName type="murder">killing</eventName> him?" </p>
            <p> Then he sat there and we said words about pro and con, trying to think, and I
               thought over everyrody I knew and I said this, more or less in a humourous way, I
               said, "The only person I know who could have had a possible motive for <eventName
                  type="murder">killing</eventName> him would be <persName ref="Ivers">Mrs. Julia
                  Crawford Ivers</persName>." I was not serious when I said that. I was more or less
               humorous. She is a lady I feel I ought to explain about, who has never done me a
               wrong thing in her life and I have never done her a wrong thing, either, but she is a
                  <orgName type="Christian">Christian Science lady</orgName> who has been associated
               with him as a <orgName type="writer">scenario writer</orgName> for <time type="years"
                  >many years</time>; she is quite a trusted, lovely woman, I am sure; a very
               honorable respectable woman, but we don't like eaeh other. There is no reason, but we
               don't like each other. Every time I wanted to see him, somehow she would be there and
               she had a strange way of treating me. She would say, Oh yes, there is little
                  <persName ref="Mary">Mary</persName>. Here she comes." She would go on in this
               manner, "Oh, there is little <persName ref="Mary">Mary</persName> again, Oh, there
               she is; wbat can she be want1ng this time? Oh, yes, uh huh." Quite a strange
               attitude, She just riled me. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Bow old a woman was she? </p>
            <p> MINTER: She must have been 50. Her son was <persName ref="Taylor">Mr
                  Taylor's</persName>
               <orgName type="cameraman">camera man</orgName>. <persName ref="Jimmy"
                  >Jimmy</persName> was my <orgName type="cameraman">camera man</orgName>, <persName
                  ref="Jim">Jim Vantrees</persName>. I don't hate the woman, but she annoys me. She
               is one of the few people in the world I dislike to see. In fact, the irony of fate it
               was when I was in <placeName type="France">France</placeName> after looking at the
               beautifUl Venus de Milo in <placeName type="France">Paris</placeName> at the
                  <placeName type="France">Louvre</placeName>, and after I had walked a few steps
               done a long hall, thinking of this excellent statue, who should I see but <persName
                  ref="Ivers">Julia Crawford Ivers</persName>, a very, fat, large woman. She did
               some more of these <orgName type="Christian">Christian Science things</orgName>, and
               she had a very unpleasant habit of whenever she would be with me and <persName
                  ref="Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>, she would always come and twit my chin. So I
               said, in really a joking manner -- I don't want to accuse the woman, because I don't
               think she had anything to do with the matter -- I said "I don't know anyone who would
               kill him but <persName ref="Ivers">Ju1ia Crawford Ivers</persName>." "I always
               suspected the woman of being in love with him herself or she might have <eventName
                  type="murder">killed</eventName> him tor that reason." He said, "My goodness! You
               mustn't say that out loud; somebody w111 believe you." I said, "I don't care if they
               do." I was in such a wild mood, Then, -- What else did we talk about? Oh! He talked
               about his <orgName type="production">productions</orgName> and said, "I certainly
               have a terrible time, working <time type="day">day</time> and <time type="night"
                  >night</time> and a great deal depended upon <date type="Saturday">Saturday</date>
               and we must get certain work finished <date type="Friday">Friday</date>." We talked
               of <date type="Friday">Friday</date>
               <time type="night">night</time> and that he had to get up at <time type="morning"
                  >eight o'clock</time>; he wasn't going to bed at all; that the boys were calling
               for him at <time type="morning">eight o'clock</time>, he said, and he knew if they
               didn't call he would never get up out of his <eventName type="sleep"
                  >slumbers</eventName>. They were going somewhere <placeName type="set">on
                  location</placeName>, I understood, possibly at the <placeName type="studio"
                  >studio</placeName>. He was just going <placeName type="home">home</placeName> and
               take a <eventName type="bathe">shower</eventName>, get a <eventName type="bathe"
                  >shave</eventName> if he felt like it, and go on back and <eventName type="work"
                  >work</eventName> some more. He said, "I am dog tired. I was never so exhausted,
               just <eventName type="dead">dead</eventName>." Finally I said, "Do you rea1ize this
               looks awful, being here all this time?" And he said, "I can't help it if it does. I
               had to tell you these things and wanted to find out what you knew about this case.
               That I know you knew <persName ref="Taylor">Bill</persName> very well, probably
               better than any of us and" -- Oh, yes. He also asked me to tel1 him my feelings
               toward <persName ref="Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>, exactly what everybody has been
               asking me, and I told him as I have been telling you, I loved him deeply, sincerely
               and absolutely; that I <eventName type="love">loved</eventName> him truly, <eventName
                  type="love">loved</eventName> him in an all-around way, I cared for his health;
               his health came before my happiness and when he was ill -- and he didn't like to see
               anyone when he was <eventName type="sick">ill</eventName>-- my natural impulse was to
               go to him and be with him and sit up <time type="night">night</time> after <time
                  type="night">night</time> with him, if necessary. l didn't do it; I didn t even
               attempt to, because he didn't want me to, and although I had sat in the dark, not
               knowing anything and worrying about it, I did that rather than intrude myself upon
               him when he didn't want me. </p>
            <p> DORAN: What time of <time type="night">night</time> dld you first meet -- What is
               this man's name? </p>
            <p> MINTER: <persName ref="Neilan">Mr Neilan</persName>? </p>
            <p> DORAN: <persName ref="Neilan">Mr Neilan</persName>, this particular night. </p>
            <p> MINTER: We went down to the <placeName type="Utah">Salt Lake station</placeName>
               after <time type="night">one</time>. </p>
            <p> DORAN: And you arrived at your <placeName type="home">home</placeName>, was it, or
               his <placeName type="home">home</placeName> or whose <placeName type="home"
                  >home</placeName> was it where you were frying the eggs? </p>
            <p> MINTER: His <placeName type="home">home</placeName>, <date type="Friday"
                  >Friday</date>
               <time type="night">night</time>; it was really <date type="Saturday">Saturday</date>
               <time type="morning">morning</time>, wasn't it? I call lt <date type="Friday"
                  >Friday</date>
               <time type="night">night</time>, because it was still <time type="night"
                  >nighttime</time>. The five of us arrived there, oh, I don't know, he didn't
               finish <eventName type="work">work</eventName> until between <time type="morning"
                  >two-thirty and three o'c1ock</time>, maybe after three; I didn't have a
                  <objectName type="jewelery">watch</objectName> at that time. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Row long approximatey do you suppose you spent talking in the <placeName
                  type="studio">studio</placeName>? </p>
            <p> MINTER: Now, let me see, we stayed at <persName ref="Marshall">Marshall's</persName>
               <placeName type="home">house</placeName> wtth the eggs and things at least an <time
                  type="hours">hour</time>, maybe<time type="hours"> two hours</time>; I am not
               certain of that at all; I don't think much more than an <time type="hours"
                  >hour</time>. Then we went right on to the <placeName type="studio"
                  >studio</placeName>, </p>
            <p> DORAN: Do you suppose you spent a <time type="hours">couple of hours</time> down
               there? </p>
            <p> MINTER: I think maybe we spent a <time type="hours">couple of hours</time>; maybe
                  <time type="hours">three hours</time>; it takes a good while to go from <placeName
                  type="Utah">Salt Lake station</placeName> up to <persName ref="Marshall"
                  >Marshall's</persName>
               <placeName type="home">home</placeName> on <placeName type="Hollywood">Sunset
                  Boulevard</placeName>. It would take at least <time type="hours">forty-five
                  minutes</time>, I think. Then it takes some time to go from his <placeName
                  type="home">home</placeName> to the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>,
               way out on <placeName type="Hollywood">Santa Monica Boulevard</placeName>. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Where was the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>? </p>
            <p> MINTER: On <placeName type="Hollywood">Santa Monica Boulevard</placeName>, the
                  <placeName type="studio">Hollyood Studios</placeName>. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Did you suggest that you go down there with him? </p>
            <p> MINTER: He said, "Let's go on down" -- No, the first thing he said was "Let's get
               out of here. I am burning up alive." It was very cold when we came in the <placeName
                  type="home">house</placeName> and we put on steam and then he got terribly hot. I
               don't know what was the matter with me, I wouldn't take off my <objectName
                  type="clothes">coat</objectName>. He said, "If you are going to stay there and
               burn, let's go out and talk." We got in the <objectName type="car">car</objectName>
               and drove around for a while. No, it is not a fact that he said in the <placeName
                  type="home">house</placeName>, "We must go to the <placeName type="studio"
                  >studio</placeName> and talk." I think I said that at first; it is not so. He
               said, "Let's go out and talk." Then it was very bitterly cold <placeName
                  type="outside">outside</placeName>, freez1ng ocld. </p>
            <p> DORAN: You left the rest of the party at the house? </p>
            <p> MINTER: No; <persName ref="Swanson">Miss Swanson</persName> and <persName
                  ref="Pickford">Mr Pickford</persName> got in <persName ref="Pickford">Mr
                  Pickford's</persName>
               <objectName type="car">Locomobile</objectName> and he said he ms going to take her
                  <placeName type="home">home</placeName>. She was very anxious to get to <placeName
                  type="bed">bed</placeName> as she had to get up early and <eventName type="work"
                  >work</eventName>. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Then, you and <persName ref="Marshall">Marshall Neilan</persName>
               <eventName type="drive">drove</eventName> around <time type="hours">awhile</time> and
               finally wound up in the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>? </p>
            <p> MINTER: Yes; we <eventName type="drive">drove</eventName> around, went out
                  <placeName type="Hollywood">Sunset Boulevard</placeName> and went up -- We went
               along <placeName type="Hollywood">Hollywood Boulevard</placeName> for a while, </p>
            <p> DORAN: What did you discuss while you were <eventName type="drive"
                  >riding</eventName> around in the <placeName type="car">machine</placeName>? </p>
            <p> MINTER: Why, about this thing about<persName ref="Taylor"> Mr Taylor</persName> and
               then also I was rather peeved na <persName ref="Marshall">Marshall</persName> at the
               time because I hadn't heard from him in weeks. "Peeved" is hardly the word. That
               sounds more as if I am interested in <persName ref="Marshall">Marshall</persName>,
               and I am; I like him, but l wasn't caring particularly; I simply said, "Well,
                  <persName ref="Marshall">Marshall</persName>, it was not a very nice thing the way
               you ran off the last time. I understood they were going out to <eventName
                  type="dinner">dinner</eventName> and you were coming to my <placeName type="home"
                  >house</placeName> to <eventName type="dinner">dinner</eventName> and suddenly you
               went to <placeName type="hollywood">San Francisco</placeName> without so much as a
               fare-thee-well."' He said, "You know I do those things." I said, "Yes, you do those
               things, and it ts very annoying, but your friends love you and love you yet in spite
               of those funny little tricks you do, darting here and there. I don't know, I am in no
               mood to take thia foolishness; I want good wholesome friendship, but I want to know
               when you are going to appear." Many times a whole <eventName type="dinner"
                  >dinner</eventName> has gotten cold waiting for him. When we had a <eventName
                  type="dinner">dinner party</eventName> at our <placeName type="home"
                  >house</placeName>, or other people have given <eventName type="party"
                  >parties</eventName>, they have waited on <persName ref="Marshall"
                  >Marshall</persName> for <time type="hours">two or three hours</time> and he
               finally would come along smiling sweetly at everybody and they couldn't scold him. I
               was more or less taking him to task for his 1ife in general, saying he should not do
               those things; it was very annoying and I was not going to put up with it. He was
               sweet and Irish and said, "You wouldn't be angry with me?" And I said, "No, I
               wouldn't be." That is the way we got out of that. There was nothing serious in the
               talk, Just the way we always talked. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Then you finally went to the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>? </p>
            <p> MINTER: Finally he said, "Now, I have got something very important to tell you,
               something that is going to hurt your feelings terribly, but I must tell you; we wi11
               go in the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName> and talk." Our teeth were
               chatter1ng with cold and we went in there and he turned on the steam and I sat in
               this <objectName type="clothes">fur coat</objectName> in a <objectName type="chair"
                  >wicker chair</objectName>, and he said, "This is going to b, a nine or
               "nineteen-days talk of the world" Then he told me all the things I have been telling
               you. There may have been some more, and some thlngs I have said may not be exactly
               accurate, but the gist of the thing is entirely accurate. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Did he declare his <eventName type="love">love</eventName> for you, whi1e
               rid1ng around in the <objectName type="car">machine</objectName>? </p>
            <p> MINTER: No, he did not. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Not until you reached the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName> did he
               do tha that? </p>
            <p> MINTER: Not until after we had been there a long time at the <placeName
                  type="studio">studio</placeName>. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Was it before or after he told you about this instance in connection with
                  <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName> -- </p>
            <p> MINTER: It was afterwards. I don't know yet whether he really meant it; maybe he was
               as sincere as he could be, and he can be very sincere, I am sure. I am sure he can. </p>

            <p>DORAN: This was the second time that <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> had
               declared love for you. On one occasion <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> proposed
               to <persName ref="minter">you</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName ref="neilan">He</persName> asked <persName ref="minter"
                  >you</persName> to marry <persName ref="neilan">him</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes, and then <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> would dart away again. I
               mean <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> would call me up -- <persName ref="neilan"
                  >He</persName> can't call me up, because I have no telephone; <persName

                  <persName ref="neilan">him</persName> in the <objectName type="vehicle"
                  >car</objectName>, not particularly about that but about other things, about
                  <eventName type="love">dinner engagements</eventName>, about appointments, I said,
               "You know, <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName>, I never know when l am going

            <p>DORAN: When did <persName ref="minter">you</persName> tell <persName ref="neilan"
                  >him</persName> that?</p>

            <p>MINTER: I told <persName ref="neilan">him</persName> that when <persName
                  ref="minterneilan">we</persName> were driving the <objectName type="vehicle"
                  >car</objectName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: How old a <persName ref="neilan">man</persName> is <persName ref="neilan"
                  >Marshall Neilan</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Just thirty.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Has <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> ever been <eventName type="marriage"
                  >married</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes, <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> has been married once for <time>a
                  few days</time>. <persName ref="neilan">He</persName> remained married to
                  <persName ref="neilanwife">his wife</persName> for a long time, for <time>seven
                  years</time>, I think, but <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> was actually only
               married a few days. I think <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> married when
                  <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> was twenty or nineteen.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Have <persName ref="minter">you</persName> seen <persName ref="neilan"
                  >him</persName> since <time>this Friday night</time>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No, I have not.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Have you talked with <persName ref="neilan">him</persName> over the
                  <objectName type="communication">telephone</objectName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: It was really <time>Saturday morning</time>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Has <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> called you up on the <objectName
                  type="communication">telephone</objectName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No; <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> may have called me at the <placeName
                  type="residence">New Hampshire house</placeName> and I wouldn't know.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName ref="minter">You</persName> haven't talked with <persName

            <p>MINTER: I haven't seen <persName ref="neilan">him</persName> or talked to <persName
                  ref="neilan">him</persName> or come in touch with <persName ref="neilan"
                  >him</persName> in any way</p>

            <p>DORAN: You haven't received any <objectName type="document">letters</objectName> from
                  <persName ref="neilan">him</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did you part friendly or unfriendly?</p>

            <p>MINTER: <persName ref="minterneilan">We</persName> did part more or less friendly, as
               I always did with <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName>, no matter how angry I
               would become with <persName ref="neilan">him</persName>, somehow you can't bear
               malice against that <persName ref="neilan">boy</persName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName ref="minter">You</persName> have become angry with <persName
                  ref="neilan">him</persName> on <date>other occasions</date>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes. This night for the time being, I was furious [missing page] [...]

                  >Jim Vantrees</persName>, <persName ref="vantrees">the camera man</persName>,
               whereupon I remarked, "I will bet <persName ref="ivers">Mrs Ivers</persName> had
               them," and I think <persName ref="vantrees">he</persName> said, "<persName ref="jim"
                  >Jim</persName> gave <objectName type="document">them</objectName> to <persName

               things that are not so here, <persName ref="doran">Mr Doran</persName>; I don't mean
               to, but I couldn't get all of it. That is as clear as I can make it. Anyway, I do
               remember this part, <persName ref="eyton">he</persName> said <persName ref="eyton"
                  >he</persName> heard about <objectName type="document">them</objectName>, and I

               went down, I believe, to the <persName ref="examiner">Examiner</persName>, to get
               ahold of <objectName type="document">them</objectName> and <persName ref="eyton"
                  >he</persName> had something to do with <placeName type="city"
                  >Pasadena</placeName>, a <persName>man</persName>, he did tell me the man's name.
               I don't remember <persName>his</persName> name, but I believe it beÂ­gan with "S", and
               this <persName ref="neilan">man</persName>, <persName ref="neilan"
                  >Marshall</persName> said he was the <persName ref="neilan">big man</persName>
               over the entire <orgName type="group">Examiner force</orgName>, told <persName
                  ref="neilan">him</persName> to go down and take the <objectName type="document"
                  >letters</objectName>. <persName ref="neilan">He</persName> said, "Of course, if

                  ref="neilan">my</persName> life," but I don't believe it will. Then <persName
                  ref="neilan">he</persName> said, "Didn't <persName ref="minter">you</persName> get
                  <objectName type="document">them</objectName> today?" I said, "<persName
                  ref="minter">I</persName> did not." As well as I remember, <persName ref="neilan"
                  >Marshall</persName> said, "I then sent <objectName type="document"
                  >them</objectName> to the <placeName type="studio">Realart Studio</placeName> and
               they ought to be in <persName ref="charley">Charley</persName>'s hands now or
                  <persName ref="garbut">Mr Garbut</persName>." This whole <time>Friday night</time>
               is most hasy in my recollection.</p>

            <p>DORAN: This <persName ref="neilan">man</persName> knew before <persName ref="minter"
                  >you</persName> were in love with <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Oh, yes.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName ref="minter">You</persName> had told <persName ref="neilan"
                  >him</persName> that, had <persName ref="minter">you</persName> not?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No; in fact, I had never said to <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName>
                  "<persName ref="minter">I</persName> am in love with <persName ref="taylor"
                  >William Desmond Taylor</persName>." I never had.</p>

            <p>DORAN: How did <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> find it out, then?</p>

            <p>MINTER: <persName ref="neilan">He</persName> knew about it, because <persName
                  ref="mintertaylor">we</persName> had been friends a long time. Before this
                  <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName> had come to <placeName type="residence"
                  >my house</placeName> very despondent and said, "I think <persName ref="neilan"
                  >I</persName> will go out in <placeName type="landscape">the garden</placeName>
               and eat wooly worms." I said, "Don't feel that way; there are plenty of us who feel
               the same way." I am certain <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> knew about
                  <eventName type="taylorandminter">this thing</eventName>. I made no secret of
                  <eventName type="taylorandminter">it</eventName>, but I didn't promenade it
               about.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Don't <persName ref="minter">you</persName> have a recollection of having told
                  <persName ref="neilan">him</persName>, <persName ref="neilan">Marshall
                  Neilan</persName>, that you were fond of <persName ref="taylor"
               >Taylor</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No. Many times I said, "I admire <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>;
               I respect <persName ref="taylor">him</persName>; <persName ref="neilan"
                  >you</persName> know I respect his opinion; what a <persName ref="taylor"
                  >wonderful man</persName> I consider <persName ref="taylor">him</persName> to be."
                  <persName ref="neilan">He</persName> knew I regarded <persName ref="taylor"
                  >him</persName> most highly.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Do you remember if <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> asked you at the time
                  <persName ref="neilan">he</persName>
               <eventName type="love">proÂ­posed</eventName> to you if you were in love with any one
               else?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No, <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> didn't ask me that at all.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did you have any admirers who might have been jealous of <persName
                  ref="neilan">him</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: There was only one possible <persName ref="dickson">admirer</persName>, and
               that was <persName ref="dickson">Mr Dickson</persName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Any besides <persName ref="dickson">Mr Dickson</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No; in fact, if I may say so, neither <persName ref="dickson">Mr
                  Dickson</persName> nor <persName ref="neilan">Mr Neilan</persName> has been with
               me constantly enough, or I feel really care enough for me to do any such thing in my
               behalf, I mean such as <eventName type="murder">commit murder</eventName>. In my own
               mind I am absolutely convinced that I know they would not.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName ref="minter">You</persName> think they are incapable, in other
               words?</p>

            <p>MINTER: I absolutely do.</p>

            <p>DORAN: What kind of <objectName ref="cigarette">cigarettes</objectName> was <persName
                  ref="neilan">Neilan</persName> smoking <time>the night</time> at the <placeName
                  type="studio">studio</placeName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: <persName ref="neilan">He</persName> smokes two kinds of <objectName
                  type="posession">cigarettes</objectName>. <persName ref="neilan">He</persName>
               smokes a gold tipped called <objectName type="posession">"Dimi"</objectName>
               something from <placeName type="country">Egypt</placeName>, I forget the name,
                  <objectName type="posession">"D" something</objectName>; I noticed <objectName
                  type="posession">it</objectName> comes from <placeName type="city"
                  >Cairo</placeName>; then <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> smokes <objectName
                  type="posession">Chesterfield cigarettes</objectName>. At least, I have seen
                  <persName ref="neilan">him</persName> smoking <objectName type="posession"
                  >Chesterfield cigarettes</objectName>. I remember that much, because I have always
               admired the face of the <objectName type="advertisement">Chesterfield
                  boy</objectName> on that <objectName type="advertisement">red back
                  sign</objectName>, you know, that <objectName type="advertisement">laughing
                  boy</objectName> in the light hair that says, "Gee"! <objectName type="posession"
                  >They</objectName> satisfy!"</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did <persName ref="neilan">Neilan</persName> take <persName ref="minter"
                  >you</persName> home then <time>that morning</time> from the <placeName
                  type="studio">studio</placeName> or did <persName ref="minter">you</persName> go
               back in <placeName type="vehicle">your own car</placeName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No; my <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName> had been driven back to
               its <placeName type="house">garage</placeName> by <persName ref="neilanchauffeur">Mr
                  Neilan's chauffeur</persName> with my <persName ref="scarborough"
                  >friend</persName>
               <persName ref="scarborough">Mr Scarborough</persName> in it. Poor <persName
                  ref="scarborough">Mr Scarborough</persName> had been driving around with me
                  <time>all evening</time>. I hadn't been able to sleep and that was why I ws_ out.
                  <persName ref="scarborough">He</persName> said if I didn't mind <persName
                  ref="scarborough">he</persName> would just go on back home, now that I was in safe
               hands, and get some sleep. <persName ref="scarborough">He</persName> was pretty near
               dead tired. <persName ref="scarborough">He</persName> isn't a very strong man.</p>

            <p>DORAN: So <persName ref="neilan">Neilan</persName> took <persName ref="minter"
                  >you</persName>
               <placeName type="residence">home</placeName> then</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes; right straight <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> ask you to keep in confidence the
                  <eventName type="conversation">conversation</eventName>
               <persName>you</persName> had had with <persName ref="neilan">him</persName>? Did
                  <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> tell you not to say anything about <eventName
                  type="conversation">it</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: l don't remember <persName ref="neilan">him</persName> saying to me, "You
               must keep this all in secret oonfidenoe"; no, I do not, because when <persName
                  ref="minterneilan">we</persName> got <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>
               we discussed some of the things with <persName ref="cshelby">mother</persName>, with
               the whole family, in fact; <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> discussed the
               seriousness of the <eventName type="conversation">conversation</eventName> and told
               me not to do anything without my <persName ref="legal">atÂ­torneys</persName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName ref="neilan">He</persName> told you <eventName type="conversation"
                  >that</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes; <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> said, "<persName>You</persName>
               mustn't make any move without your <persName ref="legal">attorneys</persName>."
                  <persName ref="neilan">He</persName> spoke of <persName ref="mott">Mr
                  Mott</persName> and said <persName ref="mott">Mr Mott</persName> was very able and
               that <persName ref="mott">he</persName> would tell me the right thing to do and not
               to <eventName type="legal">make a move</eventName> without <persName ref="neilan"
                  >him</persName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did <persName ref="minter">you</persName> comment on <persName ref="neilan"
                  >his</persName> concern?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did <persName ref="minter">you</persName> say anything to <persName
                  ref="neilan">him</persName>, for instance to this effect: "Why should <persName
                  ref="neilan">you</persName> be so concerned about <persName ref="minter"
                  >me</persName>? Why should <persName ref="minter">I</persName> consult <persName
                  ref="legal">attorneys</persName> in connection with <eventName type="legal">this
                  affair</eventName>?" or anything like that?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No, I did not, because at the time, when I asked <persName ref="neilan"
                  >him</persName> if <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> suspected me of <eventName
                  type="murder">killing</eventName>
               <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>, we had that out; <persName ref="neilan">he</persName>
               assured me <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> didn't suspect any such thing, but
                  <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> was very much impressed with the gravity of
               the situation. In fact, evidently <persName ref="neilan">he</persName> knew at that
               time exactly how these things were going to turn out. I mean that they would drag
               everybody's name into it; that the <orgName type="publishing">papers</orgName> could

            <p>MINTER: No.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Where did <persName ref="minter">you</persName> happen to be <eventName
                  type="murder">that night</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: I was at home reading the <objectName type="posession">Cruise of the
                  Kewa</objectName>. It is a <objectName type="posession">humorous
               book</objectName>; it is really a travesty of <objectName type="posession">Frederick
                  O'Brien's stories</objectName> of the South Seas. It is very funny, and I laid
               there laughing all the <time>evening</time>. I was very -- right while I was laying
               on the <objectName type="furniture">couch</objectName> reading aloud to <persName
                  ref="cshelby">mother</persName> and sister and we were all laughing heartily at
               that time, and at the same time <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor</persName> was
                  <eventName type="murder">being murdered</eventName>. It seems very horrible to
               me.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName ref="minter">You</persName> had no company at <placeName
                  type="residence">home</placeName>
               <eventName type="murder">that night</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Let me see. I don't remember any. Possibly <persName ref="stockdale">Mr
                  Stockdale</persName>, he generally did, or maybe somebody dropped in. I don't just
               remember. Usually every evening somebody drops in. I know they were not there at the
               time I was reading <objectName type="lit">the book</objectName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Your <objectName type="vehicle">automobiles</objectName> were all <placeName
                  type="residence">home</placeName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes, unless I put my <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName> in the
                  <placeName type="house">garage</placeName> called the <placeName type="business"
                  >Standard Garage</placeName>. I leave it there sometimes, the <placeName
                  type="business">Standard Garage</placeName> on <placeName type="street">Hollywood
                  Boulevard and Western Avenue</placeName>. Sometimes when my girl friends stop with
               me and have <persName ref="minterfriend">her</persName>
               <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName>, I would move out and put it in this
                  <placeName type="house">garage</placeName> and maybe wouldn't call for it for
                  <time>several days</time>. I haven't been feeling well for some time; I have had
               bronchitis. I hadn't gotten well when this awful shock came to me, and I haven't used
               the little <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName> very much.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Do you have a <persName ref="chaucy">chauffeur</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes; faithful old <persName ref="chaucy">Chauncy</persName>. <persName
                  ref="chaucy">Chauncy</persName> is just as concerned about this thing as <persName
                  ref="cshelby">my mother</persName> is.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Well, I don't think of anything else I care to inquire about now.</p>

            <p>MINTER: <persName ref="doran">Mr Doran</persName>, if I can be of any possible help
               in any way, it is true I don't know any more than I have told you; if I can, please
               call on me the first thing, won't you?</p>

            <p>DORAN: Thank you, very much. You may think of little things of which you may not
               appreciate the imporance, <persName ref="mott">Mr Mott</persName>.</p>

            <p>MINTER: As I told <persName ref="mott">Mr Mott</persName> today, I remember saying to
                  <persName ref="mott">Mr Mott</persName>, "I am so tired I am like a little child.
               I speak words mechanically. I sit, sleep, get up, walk and dress, and I don't see
               exactly what I am doing."</p>

               morning</date>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: <date>Last Thursday</date>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Yes, sir.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Do you recall that date?</p>

            <p>EYTON: It was <date>the 2nd</date>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: <date>February 2nd?</date></p>

            <p>EYTON: <date>February 2nd</date>.</p>

                  Street, 404</placeName> I think it was.</p>

            <p>NANCE: What was the cause of his death, if you know?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Well, <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName> assistant <persName
                  ref="harryFellows">[Harry Fellows]</persName> rang me up at my residence about, I
               should judge, <time>eight o'clock</time>, and told me <persName ref="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor</persName> had died suddenly; so I immediately went over to his residence,
               and he was lying on the <objectName type="floor">floor</objectName> on his
                  <objectName type="bodyPart">back</objectName>. <persName ref="ziegler">Detective
                  Ziegler</persName> was there and he had called the doctor, he told me, previous to
               my arrival; and the doctor told me <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> had
               died from hemorrhage of the <objectName type="bodyPart">stomach</objectName>.
                  <persName ref="dougMaclean">Mr. Maclean - Douglas Maclean</persName> - had told me
               that he had thought he had heard <objectName type="gun">a shot</objectName>
               <date>the night before</date>, and his wife also thought she had heard <objectName
                  type="gun">a shot</objectName> - and he wanted the <objectName type="body"
                  >body</objectName> turned over; they didn't want to turn it over until the coroner
               came. The <persName ref="coroner">deputy coroner</persName> came after a while, and
               he told us he had died of hemorrhage of the <objectName type="bodyPart"
                  >stomach</objectName>, and I told him he had better turn the <objectName
                  type="body">body</objectName> over to make sure, and he put his <objectName
                  type="bodyPart">hand</objectName> under <persName ref="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor's</persName>
               <objectName type="body">body</objectName>, and found a little - when he pulled his
                  <objectName type="bodyPart">hand</objectName> out, it had a little <objectName
                  type="bodyPart">blood</objectName> on his <objectName type="bodyPart"
                  >hand</objectName>. <persName ref="dougMaclean">Douglas</persName> asked him what
               that was, and he said it evidently had run down from his <persName ref="taylor"
                  >[Taylor's]</persName>
               <objectName type="bodyPart">mouth</objectName>, but I noticed that there was no
                  <objectName type="bodyPart">trail of blood</objectName>-<persName ref="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor's</persName>
               <objectName type="bodyPart">head</objectName> was in a <objectName type="bodyPart"
                  >pool of blood</objectName> - there was no <objectName type="bodyPart">trail of
                  blood</objectName> running down. </p>

            <p>NANCE: There was a <objectName type="bodyPart">pool of blood</objectName> under his
                  <objectName type="bodyPart">head</objectName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Under his <objectName type="bodyPart">head</objectName>, yes, a little
                  <objectName type="bodyPart">pool of blood</objectName>. I immediately opened up
                  <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName>
               <objectName type="clothing">vest</objectName>, and looked, and looked on the
               right-hand side, and there was no mark. I looked on the left-hand side and saw some
                  <objectName type="bodyPart">blood</objectName>, and then I told the <persName
                  ref="coroner">Deputy Coroner</persName> that I thought that evidence enough to
               turn his <objectName type="body">body</objectName> over to see what would happen. I
               sent for a <objectName type="furniture">pillow</objectName> to put under <persName
                  ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName>
               <objectName type="bodyPart">head</objectName>, and we turned him over - the <persName
                  ref="coroner">Deputy Coroner</persName> and myself - and we pulled his <objectName
                  type="clothing">shirt</objectName> and his <objectName type="clothing"
                  >vest</objectName> up, and we found the <objectName type="body">bullet
                  wound</objectName>. </p>

            <p>NANCE: <persName ref="eyton">Mr. Eyton</persName>, was his <objectName type="body"
                  >body</objectName> stone cold at that time?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Stone cold and very stiff and rigid.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Indicating that it had been dead for some time?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Yes.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Where was the <objectName type="body">body</objectName> lying with reference
               to the <placeName type="passage">front entrance</placeName> to his <placeName
                  type="residence">home</placeName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: It was lying right in front of a little <objectName type="furniture"
                  >desk</objectName> with the <objectName type="bodyPart">head</objectName> pointed
               east and the feet pointed west. I should judge the <objectName type="bodyPart"
                  >feet</objectName> were three or four feet from the <placeName type="passage"
                  >door</placeName> - the <placeName type="passage">front entrance</placeName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Who were present when you was there?</p>

            <p>EYTON: When I came in, the first man I noticed was <persName ref="ziegler">Detective
                  Ziegler</persName>, whom I have known for a number of years, and <persName
                  ref="dougMaclean">Douglas Maclean</persName>; <persName ref="maigne">Charles
                  Maigne</persName>; the landlord <persName ref="jessurun">[E. C.
                  Jessurun]</persName>; and <persName ref="harryFellows">Harry Fellows</persName>,
                  <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName> assistant director.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Did all of these persons live there in this <placeName type="residence"
                  >neighborhood</placeName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: That I could not tell you. <persName ref="dougMaclean">Mr. MacLean</persName>
               did, I know, because he showed me where his <placeName type="residence"
                  >apartment</placeName> was.</p>

            <p>NANCE: The place <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> lived was in a
                  <placeName type="residence">court</placeName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: In a <placeName type="residence">court</placeName>, yes.</p>

            <p>NANCE: These other <objectName type="building">buildings</objectName> were
               nearby?</p>

            <p>EYTON: There are several <placeName type="residence">apartments</placeName> in this
                  <placeName type="residence">court</placeName>, all the way around.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Did <persName type="dougMaclean">Mr. and Mrs. MacLean</persName>, or either of
               them, tell you about the <time>hour</time> that they heard the <objectName type="gun"
                  >gunshot</objectName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Yes, <persName ref="dougMaclean">Mr. Maclean</persName> told me it was
                  <time>about eight</time> or a <time>quarter after eight</time>, and <persName
                  ref="faithMaclean">Mrs. Maclean</persName> thought it was <time>a little
                  later</time>. [This is not correct.]</p>

            <p>NANCE: <date>That night?</date></p>

            <p>EYTON: Yes, <date>the night before</date>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: You didn't make any definite measurements as to the position of the
                  <objectName type="body">body</objectName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: No, sir.</p>

            <p>NANCE: So that what you testified to is only an estimate, and nothing definite about
               it.</p>

            <p>EYTON: Yes.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Now, how long has <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> lived in this
               place?</p>

            <p>EYTON: That I could not tell you. He lived in it before he went to <eventName
                  type="war">the war</eventName>, I believe.</p>

            <p>NANCE: When did you last see him alive?</p>

            <p>EYTON: <date>The same day</date> - <date>Wednesday</date>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Now, did he have any <objectName type="gun">fire-arms</objectName> of his
               own?</p>

            <p>EYTON: I believe he had a <objectName type="gun">revolver</objectName>; I believe the
                  <objectName type="gun">revolver</objectName> was in the <objectName
                  type="furniture">upper drawer</objectName>
               <placeName type="location">upstairs</placeName>; in fact, I know there was, because
                  <persName ref="ziegler">Detective Ziegler</persName> and myself went up there and
               saw it.</p>

            <p>NANCE: When you were called to this place, did you see any <objectName type="gun"
                  >fire-arms</objectName> in this <placeName type="house">room</placeName> where he
               was?</p>

            <p>EYTON: No.</p>

            <p>NANCE: What is the name of his valet, or attendant there?</p>

            <p>EYTON: <persName ref="peavey">Harry Peavey</persName>, the colored cook. I never knew
               him or saw him.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Was he the one who called you?</p>

            <p>EYTON: <persName ref="harryFellows">Harry Fellows</persName>, his assistant director,
               was the one who called me.</p>

            <p>NANCE: You have no independent knowledge of the manner in which he met his death?</p>

            <p>EYTON: No, sire.</p>

            <p><persName ref="coroner">THE CORONER</persName>: Have you any questions,
               gentlemen?</p>

            <p>NANCE: (By <persName ref="juror">a Juror</persName>) Was his <objectName
                  type="clothing">clothing</objectName> ruffled in any way, showing any
               violence?</p>

            <p>EYTON: No, absolutely none; it looked like he just walked in the <placeName
                  type="passage">door</placeName> and was shot in the <objectName type="bodyPart"
                  >back</objectName>; that is the way it looked. It didn't show evidence in the
                  <placeName type="house">room</placeName> when I got there- neither the <placeName
                  type="house">room</placeName> or the <objectName type="body">body</objectName>
               showed any evidence of a struggle. He had on the same <objectName type="clothing"
                  >suit</objectName> as when I seen him <date>the day before</date> when he talked
               to me.</p>

            <p><persName ref="coroner">THE CORONER</persName>: Is there any other questions? That is
               all, you may be excused.</p>

                  >apartment</placeName>?</p>

                  type="furniture">rug</objectName> was a little bit kicked up. It looked like he
               had kicked it with his foot.</p>

            <p>NANCE: There was no other disturbance there?</p>

               <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName> that I had moved aside. The
                  <objectName type="furniture">rocking chair</objectName> would hit the <objectName
                  type="furniture">table</objectName>, and I moved the <objectName type="furniture"

               would not hit the <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName>. It was just as I

            <p>Typical of the character of these fervent <objectName type="document"

            <p> "At what time do you think <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> was shot?"</p>

            <p> "I don't remember. Not very long, I guess, because he wanted to get home</p>

            <p> "What about this quarrel that was going on?"</p>
            <p> "Well, it was just a row, that's all. The woman was doing most of the</p>

            <p> "What have you been doing since you left Los Angeles?"</p>
            <p> "I came up to <placeName type="city">San Francisco</placeName> and went to work for
               the <orgName type="peaveyjob">Corona Typewriter</orgName></p>

            <p> "Then I came to this <placeName type="city">city</placeName> and got a job as an

            <p> He was found in a two-room apartment in the rear of a home which itself</p>
            <p> faced the street. He had as a room mate a Portuguese boy, who was not present</p>

            <p> "<persName ref="peavey">Henry</persName> likes to do fancy work," the guide

            <p> over his place."</p>
            <p> He had, and upon the various runners and doilies was an assortment of</p>

               are legion, will gather to pay the last tribute to the man they love, to one who as
               man, director and friend measured 100 per cent. </p>
            <p> "I have worked side by side with this man for seven years. We have solved many
               difficult problems together, sometimes pleasant, sometimes unpleasant: always hard,
               trying nerve-wracking. And during all these years of close association I have never
               known him to do one unkind, one ungenerous act, but I have known hundreds of
               instances of open-handed generosity and in most cases the beneficiary never knew whom

               would go back to the white, clean snows of <placeName type="state">Alaska</placeName>
               and dig his living out of the ground--this man was shot in the back by a cowardly
               assassin. He was given no opportunity to defend himself and <persName ref="taylor"
                  >William D. Taylor</persName> would have defended himself, for he did not know the

               hopes.</p>
            <p>To further acquaint herself with <placeName type="set">the Islands</placeName> and to
               absorb the atmosphere of old and new <placeName type="state">Hawaii</placeName>, she

            <p>The following week she will go to <placeName type="set">Hilo</placeName>, taking her

            <p><persName ref="ivers">Miss Ivers</persName> says she has been a scenario writer with
               the <persName ref="lasky">Lasky</persName> interest for about eight years and during
               seven years of that time was closely associated in motion <objectName
                  type="possession">picture</objectName> production with <persName ref="taylor"
                  >William D. Taylor</persName>, whose tragic death caused a temporary suspension of
               much work planned.</p>
            <p>"<persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> was a splendid <objectName
                  type="possession">picture</objectName> director," said <persName ref="ivers">Miss
                  Ivers</persName>. "He was a man of fine attainments. He was sympathetic and those
               who worked with and under his direction regarded him as one with whom it was a
               pleasure to be associated.</p>
            <p>"My own work as a scenario writer was pleasurable from the fact that there was
               co-operation. He wanted the best and we desired to give him only the best. He was a
               credit to the motion <objectName type="possession">picture</objectName> service and
               will be a loss to it, for he was of a constructive type, doing the best with the
               highest class of material."</p>
            <p>It was partly because of his death that <persName ref="ivers">Miss Ivers</persName>
               dropped her own activities for a time, superinduced by a cold, resulting in the end
               in a determination to visit <placeName type="state">Hawaii</placeName>, with
                  <persName ref="lasky">Mr. Lasky's</persName> injunction that she delve into
               Hawaiian legends and find whether any of them can be filmed.</p>
            <p><persName ref="ivers">Miss Ivers</persName> is at the <placeName type="state">Seaside
                  hotel</placeName>. She makes no promises, but is reading much about Hawaii. She is
               dictating morning and afternoon. She is going here and there where details of
               Hawaiian life may be learned.</p>
            <p>If such a motion <objectName type="possession">picture</objectName>play is to be
               written it may not deal entirely with legends, but legends may be woven into a modern
               type of play. The story of the Goddess Pele<persName/>, who dwells in <placeName
                  type="set">Kilauea volcano</placeName>, has attracted much of her attention and
               her own visit to the volcano in a week or so will have that much more interest for
               her. There is a dramatic, tragic, firey element in Pele<persName/> which may be
               converted to the screen, in her opinion.</p>
            <p> Much of <persName ref="ivers">Miss Ivers'</persName> work at the studio in Los
               Angeles is associated directly with literary folk, writers of <objectName
                  type="possession">books</objectName> whose names are known throughout the reading
                  world--<persName ref="parker">Sir Gilbert Parker</persName>, <persName
                  ref="maugham">Sydney [sic] Maugham</persName>, <persName ref="glyn">Elinor
                  Glyn</persName> and many others. It is <persName ref="ivers">Miss Ivers</persName>
               who takes their <objectName type="possession">books</objectName> and prepares or
               directs the preparation of scenarios for the director.</p>
            <p>It is this contact between the scenario writer and the authors that counts for
               success or failure in the motion <objectName type="possession">picture</objectName>
               product. If the scenario writer is sympathetic and endeavors to get the soul of the
               author's intent, there are exceptional possibilities. If not, there is more likely to
               be a failure in the interpretation.</p>
            <p> Many <objectName type="possession">books</objectName> to be screened must be ripped
               to pieces. As the story is written it can seldom be filmed. The change is the task of
               the scenario writer.</p>
            <p>Life must have been lived by scenario writers to really interpret a story for the
               screen for the eyes of the millions of theater patrons. Phases of life that are near
               the raw edge of actuality and realism may not be interpreted by the old maid who has
               not seen life and whose first impulse, and probably her last, is to eliminate that
               particular phase. A man of sensual thought may regard that particular phase as one to
               work into a maudlin interpretation which would be offensive.</p>
            <p> Between these two extremes there is the middle course and that path must be taken by
               the writer who understands life and understands the multiplicity of types and
               characters that patronize the theaters.</p>
            <p>
               <persName ref="ivers">Miss Ivers</persName> is a hard worker. She maintains high
               ideals as to <objectName type="possession">picture</objectName> production. Hers is a
               constant study of human nature. Philosophy and psychology are tangible factors with
               her, for both play important parts in decisions as to the worth of stories and the
               filmed product.</p>
            <p>"I must necessarily write in dashes where authors employ sentences and paragraphs,"
               said <persName ref="ivers">Miss Ivers</persName> discussing her method of writing. "I
               cull and cut, where book writers must enlarge and pad."</p>

                  <placeName type="set">Honolulu </placeName>to film.</p>
            <p> The beaches, mountains, gardens and palm trees of <placeName type="set">Oahu
               </placeName>and <placeName type="state">Hawaii</placeName> are to provide the setting
               for the story, which <persName ref="ivers">Mrs. Ivers</persName> says could be
               produced nowhere else in the world. "I wrote the scenario here," she told a
               representative of the Star-Bulletin at <placeName type="set"> the Moana</placeName>
               today, "and this is the only spot in the universe where it can be filmed as it should
               be. It is imbued with the breath of <placeName type="set">the islands</placeName>.
               When I returned to <placeName type="city">Los Angeles </placeName>after my visit here
               last spring, at which time I gathered material for the scenario, <persName
                  ref="lasky">Mr. Lasky</persName> asked me if the <objectName type="possession"
                  >picture</objectName> could not be produced on <placeName type="set">the
                  mainland</placeName>. 'I'll read you the story,' I replied, and I did. He had
               nothing more to say, and here we are ready to work.</p>
            <p>While the <objectName type="possession">picture</objectName> was not planned with the
               specific idea of giving publicity to <placeName type="set">the islands</placeName>,
               it still will be of tremendous benefit in portraying to mainland people the marvels
               of this section of the globe. It will be a true mirror in which those of the outer
               world may see life as it is lived in the Paradise of the Pacific.</p>
            <p> "I wrote the story," <persName ref="ivers">Mrs. Ivers</persName> said, "with a
               genuine love and affection for the islands, and I will produce it in the same way. No
               'roughneck' of a director will have a chance to squeeze the fragrance out of the
               plot, for I am going to direct the action myself. It is some time since I did that
               sort of work, but I have chosen my cast and staff myself. I know something of the
               atmosphere of <placeName type="state">Hawaii</placeName> and I wrote the story
               myself. I am just sure that if we can get things into film as we see them here the
               island will owe us a very great deal of gratitude.</p>
            <p> "One scene will be taken showing the departure of a steamer and including that
               lovable custom of giving leis, which is to me most touching. When I left <placeName
                  type="setting">Honolulu</placeName> last spring returning to <placeName
                  type="city">Los Angeles</placeName> I cried as the boat pulled away from the dock.
               I was not leaving a host of friends either, but there is something about the strains
               of 'Aloha Oe' which brings the moisture to the eyes and a catch to the throat. This
               atmosphere is what we hope to catch in our <objectName type="possession"
                  >picture</objectName>, and we hope that when it comes back to <placeName
                  type="set">Honolulu </placeName>as a finished product the people will think that
               we have done full justice to our theme."</p>
            <p>
               <persName ref="ivers">Mrs. Ivers</persName> is a pioneer in the moving <objectName
                  type="possession">picture</objectName> profession, having been identified with it
               in every sort of a capacity for the last nine years. She knows the game from A to Z.
               "I will have no one to blame if I fail to get a good <objectName type="possession"
                  >picture</objectName>," she says. "<persName ref="lasky">Mr. Lasky</persName>
               permitted me to select my own cast and to choose my technical force, camera man, art
               director and all. I am in full charge and I have every confidence in my company.
               There is not a person in it who will not go the limit to do as he or she is told. I
               know they will all give their very best to make the <objectName type="possession"
                  >picture</objectName> a success."</p>
            <p>
               <persName ref="ivers">Mrs. Ivers</persName> believes she is especially fortunate in
               her choice of her art director, George Hopkins<persName/>. "He is really very
               superior," she said, "and has done some wonderful work on interiors. He has a weird
               touch which makes his work stand out."</p>
            <p> While a number of locations have been chosen, <persName ref="ivers">Mrs.
                  Ivers</persName> said that they may not be used. "You see," she said, "the art
               director, the camera man, and electrician always inspect a location before we begin
               to 'shoot.' If any one of them has a fault to find I simply give up the location and
               seek something else that will be suitable. The art director and <objectName
                  type="film">the camera</objectName> man have to produce the artistic part of
                  <objectName type="film">the film </objectName>. I have my company in the center of
               the location and I am often called upon to move the actors to one side or another in
               order that <objectName type="film">the camera</objectName> may register striking
               features that may be at one side or the other of those of the cast. It would never do
               to have <objectName type="film">the film </objectName>unbalanced."</p>
            <p>The very newest in motion <objectName type="possession">picture</objectName>

            <p> MRS. CHARLOTTE SHELBY mother of Mary M.Minter Statement taken 4-9-26 </p>
            
            
            <p> POLICE: During the time in the east there, when he (Taylor) was directing her
               (Mary), did you observe any awakening of a friendship or love between the two of
               them?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: No.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: When did you first see that, or did you at all?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: I never did know it, <persName ref="Keyes">Mr. Keyes</persName>, until <persName ref="Mott">Mr. Mott</persName> told
               me of the letters that had been found in Taylor's <placeName type="home">drawer</placeName> that
               absolutely is convincing that there had been something there.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: You mean after he was killed</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: Yes, and <persName ref="Eyton">Mr. Eyton</persName> told me also after <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName>
               was killed that he knew that, that he knew for a long time that <persName ref="Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="Taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor</persName> had been intimate, and I said then "<persName ref="Eyton"> Mr. Eyton</persName> you
               should have told me."</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: During that time. <persName ref="Shelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> (referring to latter part of 1919
               and early part of 1920), was Mary going around with Taylor to your knowledge at
               all?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: Why no, and <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> was the most perfectly poised man, such a
               proper man. He would take Mary out to <name type="event">dinner</name> and he would invariably invite me and my
               mother to go to dinner with them.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did you make any objections?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: Not the least in the world.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Were you friendly with him?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: Oh, yes. ***</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Do you remember anyone in particular with whom she was associating at that
               time?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: It wasn't men. Men hadn't begun to give me any trouble at that time. It was
               women.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Who was that?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: <persName ref="Jeannie">Jeannie McPherson</persName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Taylor's name never entered into <name type="conversation">the discussion</name> then?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: No. I always felt that, when <persName>Mary</persName> was out with <persName ref="Taylor">Mr.
               Taylor</persName> she was under a good influence. ***</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did you ever have any words with <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> over
               <persName ref="Mary">Mary</persName>?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: Never a word, never the slightest word. (Speaking of the time <persName ref="Shelby">Mrs.
               Shelby</persName> went to <placeName type="house">Taylor's home</placeName> at 2 a.m. looking for
               <name>Mary</name>).</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did this secretary of yours, <persName ref="Whitney">Miss Whitney</persName>, go in <placeName type="house">the
               house</placeName> with you?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: No, I know she didnâÃÃ´t because there was nobody in <placeName ref="house">the
               room</placeName> but <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName> and me. She stayed in the <objectName ref="vehicle">car.</objectName></p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did you have any weapon with you at that time?</p>
            
            <p> SHELBY: Good lord, no.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: You are sure you didn't have <objectName type="weapon">a revolver</objectName> with
               you?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: No, <persName ref="Keyes">Mr. Keyes</persName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Well, you owned <objectName type="weapon">a revolver</objectName> at that time?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: No. If I owned <objectName type="weapon">a revolver</objectName> at that time, I donâÃÃ´t
               know where it was. It was thrown away.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: What date was it when you were at <placeName type="home">Mr. Taylor's home</placeName> that you were telling
               about?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: I think I could almost fix that date,<persName ref="Keyes"> Mr. Keyes</persName>, referring to
               <objectName type="book">a certain little book</objectName>, you know. Because I was reading
               <objectName type="diary">Mary's diary</objectName> and she goes on to say in this
               <objectName type="diary">diary</objectName> that she and I had some little words that evening,
               you see, and she has written it very clearly, about the small girl going out in a
               huff, etc., and she adds that mother was right. **** And I think the date of that
               happeningis right in her diary.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did you ever make a threat to kill<persName ref="Taylor"> Mr. Taylor</persName></p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: No, <persName ref="Keyes">Mr. Keyes</persName>. I never had any reason or desire to kill
               <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: And you are positive, are you, <persName ref="Shelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName>, that you never at
               any time threatened <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName>?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: Certainly not, I had no reason. I never threatened to shot <persName ref="Taylor">Mr.
               Taylor</persName>. I don't think I ever threatened to shoot any man. To shoot him? No,
               because I had no reason. I had no provocation. I never had a quarrel with <persName ref="Taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor</persName> in my life.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: You spoke of having thrown <objectName type="weapon">a gun</objectName> away?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: No, my mother did that.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: That was your gun?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: Yes. It was <objectName type="weapon">a gun</objectName> I used once. I shot it once and
               once was enough.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: How long had you had <objectName type="weapon">the gun</objectName>?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: <objectName type="weapon">The gun</objectName> was given to me in Santa Barbara by
               <persName ref="Harry Eaves">Harry Eaves</persName>, who has <placeName type="jewelry_shop">a jewelry shop</placeName> up there âÃÃ® <objectName type="weapon">a very
                  short little pistoi</objectName> - a little automatic - ***** and he said to me,
               "I have got two and you ought to have one.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Where did you say you shot it once?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: I got a friend of mine to take me out in <placeName type="Santa_Barbara">Santa
               Barbara</placeName>, just off the road, and we shot it into a bank and I shot it
               once.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did you ever do any target practice with it?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: Yes, that one time. It was enough for me. The thing was too short. I can
               shoot a long pistol. I wouldnâÃÃ´t mind shooting <objectName type="weapon">a shot gun</objectName>. ***</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Well, <persName ref="Shelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName>, <persName ref="Mary">Mary</persName> shot that
               <objectName type="weapon">pistol</objectName> off one time, didn't she?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: Yes, she shot it off twice.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Was that the "suicide"?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: ThatâÃÃ´s the âÃÃºsuicideâÃÃ¹ (Re: supposed suicide) "Well, we were living at
               <placeName type="home">56 Fremont Place</placeName>. **** I remember the secretary was there

               But she ran up the stairs and ran in my room and closed the door.</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Oh, locked <placeName type="home">the door</placeName>, and the first thing we knew- bang. *** and a second more
               and - bang âÃÃ¬ the second shot. **** The chauffeur (<persName ref="Chauncey">Chauncey Eaton</persName>)
               appeared, and <persName ref="watchman">the night watchman</persName> (?), and I said "Break in the door" The two men

               They picked her up so tenderly, and <persName>Chauncey</persName> turned her over and he said, "Why,

               she had been out with . But there was no quarrel about <name ref="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</name>? It
               seems to me she mentioned Taylor's name. I don't remember now, or what. Then the
               report that I got that you have been practicing some rerevolver shooting - is there
               anything to that? I told you I shot it once. I know a man who will verify it -

               had been shot into my closet, and we found that, and another one went up in the

               he said, "Here, give me that. ThatâÃÃ´s enough of <objectName type="weapon" >pistols</objectName> lying around.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: What did she do with it. I never saw it again. I think I asked her once or
               twice what she did with it, and she said, "It's out. It's put away."</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: I had <name type="engagement">an engagement</name> with a man the next morning at 9 o'clock. ** This man was
               a client of a friend of my daughter's, <name ref="Albert">Mr. Albert Heiner</name>. *** I also had
               been talking to a man about buying <objectName type="music">an Aeolian Organ</objectName>, and he stopped in that morning
               *** And while these two men were in the room, the telephone rang. It was then a
               little after 9, and <persName ref="Stockdale">Mr. Carl Stocktdle</persName> called me up. He had gone to the
               studio to work and had learned of the death of <persName ref="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName>.
               Naturally, knowing that he directed <persName ref="Mary">Mary</persName>, he called me up and told me
               that <persName ref="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName> had been found dead that morning.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Just what did he tell you?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: He said, "<persName ref="Shelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName>, I just wanted to call you up and tell
               you, I am at <placeName type="studio">the studio</placeName>. <persName ref="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName> was found dead this
               morning." "Oh," I said, "that's terrible." That's all he knew. ** I turned to these
               gentlemen and said, "Oh, my, it's terrible. A man who directed my daughter, a very
               charming gentleman, was found dead this morning." **** Then <objectName type="telephone">the
                  telephone</objectName> rang again and the inevitable Miss Berger again. *** I
               said, "Oh, <persName ref="Margery">Margery</persName>, <persName ref="Stockdale">Mr. Stockdale</persName> just telephoned me from
               <placeName type="studio">the studio</placeName> that <name ref="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</name> was found dead this
               morning." **** In a few minutes <objectName type="telephone">the telephone</objectName> rang again.
               *** This time <persName>Miss Berger</persName> said, "<persName ref="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName> was
               murdered this morning. He was shot." I said, "Oh, my, this is terrible; the man was
               murdered," Was shot? So we discussed that and the organ man knew I was waiting to go
               out with <persName ref="Rice">Mr. Rice</persName> so ** <persName ref="Rice">Mr. Rice</persName> and I got in his car *** and I said, âÃÃºMr. Rice, do
               you mind if I stop at <placeName type="house">my house</placeName> and tell my people?" *** and it seems to me that on
               the way crossing <placeName type="Vermont">Vermont</placeName> met my mother coming over in a car with the chauffeur and I
               just waved to her to turn around and come on back with us. I remember that
               distinctly. ***** I was in a great hurry because <persName ref="Rice">Mr. Rice</persName> was waiting
               for me in front, and I remember the chauffeur had parked <objectName type="car">my blue Packard</objectName> in the
               <placeName type="house">driveway</placeName>, and something was said about Mary wanted <objectName type="vehicle">the car</objectName>.
               <persName ref="Chauncey">Chauncey</persName> had gone to get <objectName type="vehicle">Mary's car</objectName>. However, I went
               <placeName type="house">upstairs</placeName> in a great hurry, and I said, "Oh,
               <persName ref="Julia"> Julia</persName>, dear, Mr. Taylor was murdered last night." She said, "Oh, it
               isn't possible. I can't believe it. It isn't true." I said, "Oh, yes, it is.
               <persName ref="Berger">Miss Berger</persName> told me so." *****</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did <persName ref="Woolwine">Mr. Woolwine</persName> ever try to take your statement?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: No, he never asked me a thing, <persName ref="Keyes">Mr. Keyes</persName>. Nobody ever questioned
               me.</p>
            
            <p>MR. MOTT: Tell <persName ref="Keyes">Mr. Keyes</persName> exactly now, that part of the conversation with
               <persName ref="Chauncey"> Chauncey</persName>?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: I said "<persName ref="Chauncey">Chauncey</persName>, what did you tell them?" He said, "I told them
               that you called me up very early that morning, about half past seven, and my wife
               said you went ever there without breakfast; that you wanted to go over to
               <placeName type="Horbart_house">the Hobart house</placeName>." I said, "The morning of the Taylor
               murder." He said, "Yes." I said, "Why, I couldn't have known until after 9
               oâÃÃ´clock.âÃÃ¹ He said that he drove me over that morning and said that I was at the
               wisdom with <objectName type="papers">the papers</objectName> I said, "How could that be; besides there wasn't any <objectName>papers</objectName>
               that morning." "No," he said, "that's what they told me down at <placeName type="office">the
                  office</placeName>, that there wasnâÃÃ´t any papers that early." I said, "Well,
               that's nothing, it is just a laps of memory, it is of no consequence." And finally he
               saw he was in the wrong. I explained to him that <persName ref="Rice">Mr. Rice</persName> had driven me
               over."</p>
            
            <p>MR. MOTT: Now explain that Monte Blue proposition.</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: (<persName ref="Shelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> tells about some night when Mary had failed to come
               <placeName type="house"> home</placeName>, and they had looked for her until about 2:30 a.m. and finally located
               <objectName type="vehicle">her car</objectName> in front of <placeName type="house">Charlotte Whitney's house</placeName>) So <persName>Margaret</persName> and I rushed in and went up the steps
               hurriedly and opened <placeName type="house">the door</placeName> and came upon Mary &amp; Monte (Blue) on the couch. The
               door opened right into the front room. This Monte Blue started to run out into <placeName type="house">the
                  kitchen</placeName> and out <placeName type="house">the back door</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: You mean that they were in a compromising position?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: Yes. I was about the maddest woman that could ever be. I grabbed this
               halfbreed Indian by his shirt tail and I said, "Come right back in <placeName type="house">this
                  room</placeName>. I have something very forceful to say to you. Come back
               here!"</p>
            
            <p>MR. DAVIS: That time she went out with <persName ref="Marshall">Marshall Neilan</persName>, after the
               murder; wasn't that about two nights afterwards?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: Yes.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Immediately afterwards, wasn't it?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: It was.</p>
            
            <p>MR. KEYES: She tried to kill you, you say?</p>
            
            <p>SHELBY: Yes. *** Oh, "Mary said around the house freely. "Oh, <name>4</name> killed
               <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName>". Not only once but many times. The was always saying that.</p>

               Interviews with <persName ref="ethel">Ethel Mae Harrison</persName>
               
               <date>February 13, 1922</date>
               <orgName type="newspaper">NEW YORK HERALD</orgName> </p>
            
            <p>...<persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName>, who married <persName ref="Taylor">William Cunningham Deane-Tanner</persName>, or <persName ref="Taylor">William
               Desmond Taylor</persName>, as he was later known, in <date>1902</date>, said her former husband had
               spent some time on a <placeName type="job">pony ranch</placeName> in <placeName type="region">southwestern</placeName> <placeName type="state">Kansas</placeName> before <persName ref="ethel">she</persName> met him in
               <placeName ref="city">New York</placeName>.  The only information she had ever had was that which <persName ref="Taylor">Deane-Tanner</persName>
               gave her personally.</p>
            
            <p>"<persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Deane-Tanner</persName> told me that when he arrived here from <placeName type="country">Ireland</placeName> he had
               gone out to this <placeName type="job">ranch</placeName>," <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> said, "and his family in <placeName type="country">Ireland</placeName> had
               <eventName type="investment">bought</eventName> for him a part interest in it.  When I met him he referred to it and
               told me a flaw in the <objectName type="document">title</objectName> had forced several of the shareholders,
               including <persName ref="Taylor">himself</persName>, to give up their part, and he then joined the <orgName type="company">Davenport
                  road company</orgName>.  After the failure of his venture in <placeName>Kansas</placeName> he returned to his
               home in <placeName type="country">Ireland</placeName> for a visit.</p>
            
            <p>"With reference to the claim of this <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> in <placeName ref="state">California</placeName> that he
               is the son of the murdered <persName ref="Taylor">director</persName>, I would not like to say flatly that the
               claim is or is not true, for I knew little of <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Deane-Tanner's</persName> life on the
               <placeName type="job">ranch</placeName> in <placeName type="state">Kansas</placeName> and did not find it necessary to catechize him minutely, and
               he never mentioned anything to me about having been married out there.
               Perhaps there is some truth in the story, or it may be another of the many
               persons who come forward whenever there is an <objectName type="money">estate</objectName> to be settled.  I have
               been interested in the number of persons who claim <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Deane-Tanner</persName>, or
               <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName>, was their father.  To date he must have had at least six or seven
               children besides my own daughter, if the stories are all correct.  As <persName ref="Taylor">Mr.
                  Deane-Tanner</persName> would only be about <time>fifty years</time> old now, that is rather
               ridiculous, I think."</p>
            
            <p> Referring to the criminal end of the case, <persName ref= "ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> criticized the
               work of the <placeName type="city">Los Angeles</placeName> detectives and prosecutors, saying they do not seem
               to be particularly anxious to solve the mystery of the identity of the
               murderer.</p>
            
            <p>"<persName ref="ethel">I</persName> have bitterly resented the accounts printed in some of the
               newspapers here that my daughter and myself are merely interested in the
               financial part of the affair and are more interested in the <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName> <objectName ref="money">estate</objectName>
               than in the identity of the person who killed my former husband.  This is
               absolutely untrue, for, as <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName> former wife, I am deeply grieved at
               this terrible affair and am anxious to see the guilty person punished."
               Returning to the discussion of the claim of the man who says the <persName ref="Taylor">movie
                  director</persName> was his <persName ref="Taylor">father</persName>, <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> said that it seemed improbable that her
               first husband ever used the name of <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName> before he left <placeName type="city">New York</placeName> in <date>1908</date>.
               <persName ref="ethel">She</persName> said that to old friends who knew him when he first came to <placeName type="country">this country</placeName>
               and had been in constant touch with him during his stay in <placeName type="state">Kansas</placeName> nothing
               was known of any marriage while he was in the <placeName>West</placeName>.  After that, and until
               he <eventName type="leaving">disappeared</eventName>, <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> said, he never used the name of <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName>, or
               referred extensively to his visit to the <placeName type="job">ranch</placeName> in the <placeName type="region">West</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p>"I never really knew <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Deane-Tanner's</persName> right age," <persName>Mrs. Robins</persName> said,
               "and I understood that he had been in <placeName type="country">his country</placeName> about eight or nine years,
               when I <eventName type="marriage">married</eventName> him at the <orgName type="church">Little Church Around the Corner</orgName> in <date>1901</date>.  He was a
               fine, lovable man, and I never had occasion to closely question him about
               his 'past,' which every one seems trying to <eventName type="investigation">dig up</eventName>."</p>
            
            <p>No decision whether <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> or her daughter, <persName ref="daughter">Ethel</persName>, will go to
               <placeName type="state">California</placeName> in connection with the settling of the <objectName type="money">estate</objectName> has been reached.
               <persName ref="frank">Frank E. Schrenseisen</persName> of <placeName type="city">New Rochelle</placeName>, attorney for <persName>Miss Tanner</persName>, said that
               he was awaiting developments and instructions from the office of the Public
               <title type="politician">Administrator</title> in <placeName type="city">Los Angeles</placeName>.  Another attorney for <persName ref="ethel">Miss Tanner</persName> has been
               engaged in <placeName type="city">Los Angeles</placeName>.  Should the <title type="politician">Public Administrator</title> place credence in
               the story of <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName>, it is probable that <persName ref="ethel">Miss Tanner</persName> will accompany her
               attorney to <placeName type="region">the coast</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p> "<persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Deane-Tanner</persName> told my <persName ref="daughter">daughter</persName> that he had made a <objectName type="document">will</objectName> in her
               favor," <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> said, "and had placed it in his <objectName type="bank">safe deposit box</objectName>.  I
               understand that this is another one of the <objectName type="document">items</objectName> which the <orgName type="law">police</orgName> say have
               strangely '<eventName type="disapearnce">disappeared</eventName>.'  What he did with it I have no idea, but I feel
               that the entire matter will be straightened out.  Just at present I am
               hoping that the murderer of <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> will be brought to justice for this
               terrible crime."</p>
            
            <p><persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> commented on the strange disappearance of <persName ref="dennis">Dennis Deane-
               Tanner</persName>, <persName ref="dennis">brother</persName> of the murdered <persName ref="Taylor">director</persName>, and said she had never heard a
               word from him since he left this <placeName type="city">city</placeName> in <date>1912</date>, just <time>four years</time> after her
               husband <eventName type="disappearance">disappeared</eventName>.  She said the two brothers had been good friends and
               business associates, and that <persName ref="dennis">Dennis</persName> had visited their home at <placeName type="town">Larchmont</placeName> on
               several occasions, and had met many of their friends.  There was never any
               trouble between the brothers as far as she knew, <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins </persName>said.</p>
            
            <p><date>February 14, 1922</date>
               <orgName type="newspaper">NEW YORK AMERICAN</orgName></p>
            
            <p>To the two names suggested in the <orgName type="newspaper">New York American</orgName> <date>yesterday</date>--<persName ref="sands">Edward
               F. Sands</persName> and <persName ref="dennis">Dennis Gage Deane-Tanner</persName> as persons whose discovery may furnish
               a clue to the identity of the slayer of <persName ref="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName>--was added
               <date>yesterday</date> a third.</p>
            
            <p> The third person is a woman, a fascinating blonde who was the companion
               of <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName> (or <persName ref="Taylor">W. C. Deane-Tanner</persName>, as he was then known) on a trip through
               the <placeName type="region">Adirondacks</placeName> during the <date>Summer of 1908</date>, <date>three months prior</date> to the sudden
               disappearance of <persName ref="Taylor">"Pete" Tanner</persName> in <date>late October, 1908</date>.</p>
            
            <p>This woman, who had completely enchained the fancy of the aristocratic,
               handsome <persName ref="Taylor">Tanner</persName>, was married.  Her identity is said to be known to a few of
               <persName ref="Taylor">Tanner's</persName> associates of the old days when he was a director in the <orgName type="company">A. J.
                  Crawford Company</orgName> firm at <placeName type="address">No. 253 Fifth avenue</placeName>.  She was the co-respondent in
               the divorce <eventName type="divorce">suit</eventName> instituted some two years after <persName ref="Taylor">"Pete" Tanner's</persName>
               disappearance by <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Ethel May Hamilton Robins</persName>, now the wife of <persName ref="robins">Edward L.
                  C. Robins</persName>, managing proprietor of <orgName type="restaurant">Delmonico's</orgName>.</p>
            
            <p>Does this hitherto hidden episode in the life of the murdered <persName ref="Taylor">man</persName> bear
               any significance upon the crime?</p>
            
            <p>Was the woman's husband implacably determined to <eventName type="revenge">avenge</eventName> himself upon
               the <persName ref="Taylor">man</persName> who had won the affections of his wife?</p>
            
            <p>Was it the hand of the husband that <eventName type="murder">fired</eventName> the fatal <objectName type="bullet">bullet</objectName> (from twelve
               to fourteen years old, according to the testimony of experts in ballistics)
               that killed <persName ref="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName>?</p>
            
            <p> ...At her home, <placeName type="house">Orienta Point,</placeName> <placeName type="town">Mamaroneck</placeName>, <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName>, former wife of
               the slain <persName ref="Taylor">director</persName>, <date>yesterday</date> refused to discuss this episode in the life of
               her former <persName ref="Taylor">husband</persName>.  <persName ref="ethel">She</persName> refused to see <persName ref="reporter">newspaper men</persName> but told a friend:
               "<persName ref="ethel">I</persName> would do anything in my power to solve the mystery of <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Tanner's</persName>
               death but I do not think there can be any possible relation between this
               incident and the crime.  It was not until <date>long after</date> <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Tanner's</persName>
               disappearance that I learned definitely there was another woman in his life.
               "This information was placed in the hands of my attorney, <persName ref="george">Mr. George
                  Thoms</persName>, and he brought a successful <eventName type="divorce">suit</eventName> for divorce against <persName>Mr. Tanner</persName>.
               This was in <date>the latter part of 1918</date> [sic].  At that time I did not know
               whether <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Tanner</persName> was dead or alive.</p>
            
            <p>"It was <date>later</date>, perhaps <date>seven years ago</date>, that I <eventName type="recognize">saw</eventName> <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Tanner</persName> for the
               first time on the screen.  I cannot remember the name of the photoplay in
               which he appeared.  However, it was not until <date>two and one-half years ago</date>
               that I learned definitely that <persName ref="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName> was my former
               husband."</p>
            
            <p><date>February 14, 1922</date>
               <orgName type="newspaper">WASHINGTON TIMES</orgName></p>
            
            <p> <placeName type="city">New York</placeName>, <date>Feb. 14</date> -- Of the many screen stars he knew, some of whom
               have been thrown squarely into the spotlight by the unrelenting inquiry into
               his association with <persName ref="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName>, slain director, mentioned but
               one--<persName ref="minter">Mary Miles Minter</persName>--in his letters to his nineteen-year-old <persName ref="daughter">daughter</persName>,
               <persName ref="daughter">Miss Ethel Daisy Deane-Tanner</persName>.</p>
            
            <p> Disclosing this fact to a reporter today, <persName ref="daughter">Miss Tanner</persName> and her mother,
               <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Edward L. C. Robins</persName>, who live in <placeName type="town">Mamaroneck</placeName>, both of whom were <eventName type="abondon">deserted</eventName>
               by the man of mystery in <date>1908</date>, said that <persName ref="minter">Miss Minter's</persName> name was used by the
               <persName ref="Taylor">director</persName> only in an impersonal way.</p>
            
            <p><persName ref="Taylor">He</persName> referred to <persName ref="minter">her</persName> as an actress of ability, and said he had directed
               <persName ref="minter">her</persName> in some of her photoplays.  This was one of the last letters written to
               his daughter by <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName> before he was <eventName type="murder">murdered</eventName> in his <placeName type="city">Los Angeles</placeName> <placeName type="house">bungalow</placeName>.
               <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> and her <persName ref="daughter">daughter</persName> expressly asserted that the name of <persName ref="mabel">Mabel
                  Normand</persName>, screen comedienne, and last person to see the director alive, did
               not appear in <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor's</persName> letters to his <persName ref="daughter">daughter</persName>, which had been more or less
               frequent during the <date>last two years</date>.</p>
            
            <p>Curiously enough, (and one reason why <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> is increasingly
               inclined to the opinion that her husband's sudden <eventName type="abandon">disappearance</eventName> from <placeName type="city">New
                  York</placeName> was due to loss of memory), her former husband never mentioned her in
               the letters.</p>
            
            <p>Another reason for this belief, she declared, was that on the times she
               and her <persName ref="daughter">daughter</persName> lunched here with <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName>--after it was definitely
               established that <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName> was in reality <persName ref="Taylor">Deane-Tanner</persName>--he never mentioned the
               fact that he <eventName type="abandon">deserted</eventName> his <persName ref="ethel">wife</persName> and <persName type="ethel">daughter</persName>.  On these occasions all three
               felt the subject was rather delicate and it was never brought up.
               <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> said that when <persName type="ethel">she</persName> and her <persName ref="daughter">daughter</persName> became convinced <date>two
                  years ago</date>, after seeing pictures of <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName>, that he was the girl's father,
               <persName ref="daughter">Miss Deane-Tanner</persName> took the initiative and wrote to him.  His reply came
               <time>immediately</time>.</p>
            
            <p>In it he said he was very glad to hear from her; that he had not heard
               from he for so <time>long</time> that he thought <persName ref="daughter">she</persName> was dead.  This is one more reason
               why <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> believes her former <persName ref="Taylor">husband</persName> was a victim of aphasia when he
               left, after attending the <placeName type="town">Vanderbilt</placeName> cup races in <date>1908</date>.
               <persName>Taylor</persName> also, <persName>Mrs. Robins</persName> asserted, was unable to recall friends of
               their married life, and when their names were mentioned, his face failed to
               show the slightest signs of remembrance.  He did remember, however, favorite
               dishes of his former wife when he was dining with his daughter, pointing
               them out to the latter on the menu during their luncheon together.
               <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> declared that these points proved that his mind, while
               vague as to consequential facts about <persName ref="ethel">her</persName> married life with the <persName ref="Taylor">director</persName>,
               retained minor details.</p>
            
            <p> The director's experiences in <placeName type="state">Alaska</placeName> also were set forth in one <objectName type="letter">letter</objectName>.
               <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName> told of how he contracted scurvy, consequently suffering from loss of
               hair, headaches and neuralgia.  Another letter dismissed with a few scornful
               words <persName ref="sands">Sands</persName>, his chauffeur, who is still being sought by <orgName type="law">police</orgName>.  The
               <persName ref="Taylor">director</persName> declared <persName ref="sands">Sands</persName> had upset his home and said his name had been forged
               to checks by his unfaithful servant.</p>
            
            <p>Signatures <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName> used in his letters to his <persName ref="daughter">daughter</persName>, for whom he
               showed deep devotion, were "<persName ref="Taylor">Father</persName>" and "<persName ref="Taylor">Daddy Pete</persName>."  The origin of how
               <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName> came to be known as "<persName ref="Taylor">Pete</persName>" was explained by <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName>.  She said
               when <persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName>, or as he was known then, <persName ref="Taylor">Deane-Tanner</persName>, first came to live in
               <placeName type="city">New York</placeName> he took lodging with several Englishmen.</p>
            
            <p><persName ref="Taylor">Taylor</persName>, always deliberate and calculating in his methods, was nicknamed
               "<persName ref="Taylor">P. D. Q.</persName>," by his roommates, which was quickly shortened to "<persName ref="Taylor">Pete</persName>."
               The <persName ref="Taylor">director's</persName> promise to leave his <objectName type="money">estate</objectName> to his <persName ref="daughter">daughter</persName> was
               contained in a <objectName type="letter">letter</objectName> written in <date>February, 1920</date>.  <persName ref="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> said her
               former husband said in this message he thought it would be good policy to
               leave them both an <objectName type="money">annuity</objectName>, in addition to telling of his <objectName type="document">will</objectName> bequeathing
               his <objectName type="money">estate</objectName> to <persName ref="daughter">Ethel Daisy</persName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: What did he say?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: "Help, <orgName type="law">Police</orgName>, <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> is
               dead."</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did the fact that <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> was dead remind you of
               anything that occurred <eventName type="murder">the night before</eventName> * did you hear a
               shot.</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: Yes, what we thought might be a shot or a <objectName type="vehicle">muffler</objectName>
               explosion, I do not know which.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: When did you hear that?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: Sometime probably between <time>quarter of eight and eight o'clock</time> on
               <date>Wednesday evening</date>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Now, at the time you heard this shot did you go out on <placeName type="house">the
               porch</placeName>?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: Yes, shortly after *** oh, about, I suppose three or four seconds, maybe a
               minute.</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: No I did not I just opened my <objectName type="house">front door</objectName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Well, what did you say?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: I saw <persName ref="murderer">a man</persName> had already opened the <objectName type="passage">door</objectName> of
               <placeName type="residence">Mr. Taylor's house</placeName> and was looking towards
               <placeName type="location">Alverado St</placeName>. *** I didn't see <persName ref="murderer">him</persName> open the
               <objectName type="passage">door</objectName>; it was already open I think.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Which way was the <objectName type="door">screen</objectName>?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: The <objectName type="door">screen door</objectName> was open. I think the
               <objectName type="door">screen door</objectName> was open then it must have been to have seen
               <persName ref="murderer">his</persName> figure as clearly as I did.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did <persName ref="murderer">he</persName> shut the <objectName type="passage">door</objectName>?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: It seems like <persName ref="murderer">he</persName> shut the <objectName type="passage">door</objectName>. It seems like <persName ref="murderer">he</persName>
               leaned in and pulled it closed.</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: So it must have been opened because I distinctly saw <persName ref="murderer">his</persName>
               <objectName type="clothing">cap</objectName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: You are satisfied are you, that the light came from <placeName type="scene">Taylor's
               apartment</placeName> out on <placeName type="passage">the street</placeName> through the
               <objectName type="passage">open door</objectName>?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: Yes.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did <persName ref="murderer">he</persName> seem in a hurry?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: No, <persName ref="murderer">he</persName> was the coolest thing I have ever seen * * *. <persName ref="murderer">He</persName> turned around and
               looked at me and hesitated. Then it seems as if * * * that <persName ref="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor</persName> must have spoken to <persName ref="murderer">him</persName> from inside <placeName type="scene">the house</placeName> 
               *** <persName ref="murderer">he</persName> thought he had spoken and he didn't. Seemed like <persName ref="murderer">he</persName>
               pulled the <objectName type="passage">door</objectName> shut, then turned around and looking at me
               all the time, walked down a couple of <objectName type="house">steps</objectName> that go up to <placeName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor's
                  house</placeName> there.</p>
            <p>POLICE: Do you know whether <persName ref="murderer">the man</persName> that you saw went to <placeName type="location">Alvarado
               St</placeName>. through the open court there?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: <persName ref="murderer">He</persName> went towards <placeName type="location">Maryland St.</placeName> and towards
               <placeName type="passage">the alley</placeName> in <placeName type="passage">between the two houses</placeName>
               because <persName ref="murderer">he</persName> was facing that way ready to go when I closed the
               <objectName type="passage">door</objectName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: You knew it wasn't <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>.</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: Oh, I knew it wasn't <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Could you have recognized <persName ref="murderer">the man</persName> 1f it had been <persName ref="taylor">Mr.
               Taylor</persName>.</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: Oh, yes, positively. </p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Now, is it possible that it might have been this young man <persName ref="howardFellows">Howard
               Fellows</persName>, the chauffeur, that you saw there. Could that be possible.</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: I suppose it could be possible but it doesn't seem to me that he was <persName ref="murderer">the boy
               or was the man</persName>. He doesn't seem the built of <persName ref="murderer">that man</persName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did <persName ref="murderer">the man</persName> you saw have a smooth face?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: Yes, <persName ref="murderer">he</persName> did have a smooth face.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did <persName ref="murderer">the man</persName> you saw have on anything like a <objectName type="clothing">chauffeur's
               uniform</objectName>?</p>
            
            <p> MACLEAN: Well, the only thing I noticed was <persName ref="murderer">his</persName> <objectName type="clothing">cap</objectName>,
               something tied around <persName ref="murderer">his</persName> throat. I don't know whether <persName ref="murderer">the man</persName> had an
               <objectName type="clothing">over-coat</objectName> or not.</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: <persName ref="murderer">His</persName> age I don't know but I should judge <persName ref="murderer">the man</persName> was probably between 30 and
               35. <persName ref="murderer">He</persName> was about <height>5 feet nine</height>, just about ***, and <persName ref="murderer">he</persName> was stocky, not
               fat, but stocky. <persName ref="murderer">He</persName> had on a <objectName type="clothing">cap</objectName>. It seemed like a checked
               <objectName type="clothing">cap</objectName> with a plaid in it, and <persName type="clothing">he</persName> wore something around <persName ref="murderer">his</persName>
               throat.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Smooth shaven?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: Yes.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Color of <persName ref= "murderer">his</persName> <objectName type="clothing">suit</objectName>?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: No, except it was a dark <objectName type="clothing">suit</objectName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Now didn't compare in size with <persName ref="smith">Mr. Smith</persName>,the
               reporter here, who is taking this statement? (<persName ref="smith">Mr.
                  Smith</persName> was about <height>5' 7 1/2"</height>)</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: No, <persName ref="smith">Mr. Smith</persName> is shorter. (The witness names the
               following men: <persName ref="king">Mr. Henry King</persName>, <persName ref="hamilton">Mr. Mahlon Hamilton</persName>, <persName ref="hoyt">Mr. Arthur Hoyt</persName>, <persName ref="berris">Mr. Berris</persName> (first
               name Nigle?), <persName ref="ince">Mr. Ince</persName>, <persName ref="neilan">Mr. Marshal Neilan</persName>. Witness was then asked the following
               questions)</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Now then, tell me whether there is any possibility that <persName ref="murderer">this man</persName> you saw
               coming out of there was any of the persons that you have mentioned?</p>
            
            <p>MACLEAN: No, I think not. I think I would have recognized any of those people.</p>
            
            <p>** when <persName ref="murderer">he</persName> came out <persName ref="murderer">he</persName> was dressed as my idea of a <objectName type="description">moving picture
               burglar</objectName>**? ** because I remember thinking perhaps <persName ref="murderer">he</persName> might have been
               one of the boys in <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName> company when they go out on
               location. MACLEAN: Not well dressed. I don't know as I would say slovenly but I don't
               think <persName ref="murderer">he</persName> was well dressed.</p>

            <p>Statement taken 3-10-26, at 10 AM.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: You do have a recollection then that she was <persName ref="minter"> (Mary)</persName>home
               at <eventName type="eating">dinner</eventName> that <time type="time">evening</time>?</p>
            
            <p>FILLMORE: Oh, absolutely, because <persName ref="shelby">mama</persName> had cooked this dinner
               <persName ref="minter">she</persName> particularly liked and hoped <persName ref="shelby">she</persName> would come home to it.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: How long did <persName ref="minter">she</persName> remain there?</p>
            <p> FILLMORE: <time type="evening">After dinner</time> we went into the <placeName type="house">living
               room</placeName> and <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName> laid on the <objectName type="furniture">couch</objectName> and read a <objectName type="lesiure">book</objectName> called
               <objectName type="posession">"The Cruise of the South Sea Islands"</objectName>. It was rather a
               dry book, but the way <persName ref="minter">she</persName> read it was interesting and we simply sat around <placeName type="residence">home</placeName> and
               enjoyed our evening at <placeName type="redsidence">home</placeName>, the three of us. Now I know <persName ref="shelby">mother</persName>
               was not at <placeName type="redsidence">home</placeName>, because if <persName ref="shelby">she</persName> was, <persName ref="shelby">she</persName> would have been
               there, <persName ref="fitts">Mr. Fitts</persName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: What time did you folks retire that evening?</p>
            
            <p>FILLMORE: We stayed up quite late, I guess <persName ref="shelby">mama</persName> retired about
               <time type="evening">10 or 11 o'clock</time>. <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="mshelby">I</persName> stayed up and

            <p>POLICE: Well, you are quite positive that, after <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName> came <placeName type="redsidence">home</placeName> that afternoon, she
               didn't go out again at all during the evening?</p>
            
            <p>FILLMORE: I am positive in this way; that we stayed up unti1 about <time type="evening">12
               o'clock</time>, until after <persName ref="shelby">mama</persName> went to bed and <placeName type="house">Mary's room</placeName> is right next to mine
               and <persName ref="mshelby">I</persName> didn't hear <persName ref="minter">her</persName> go out. <persName ref="mshelby">I</persName> am quite sure <persName ref="minter">she</persName> didn't.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: But you just said a few moments ago that she could come in without your

            <p>POLICE: You are, then, positive that your mother was not at the <placeName type="redsidence">Hobart house</placeName> that

            <p>POLICE: Could it have been after <time ref="time">9 o'clock</time> when <persName ref="shelby">she</persName> came in?</p>
            
            <p>FILLMORE: It could have been. As <persName ref="mshelby">I</persName> say, it was early in the morning. I know it wasn't
               as late as <time ref="time">11</time>.</p>

               way at all, that were associating with or closely associated with them immediately
               prior to, or immediately after, Taylor's murder?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: <persName type="periolet">M. George Periolet</persName>. is at <placeName type="redsidence">Engstrom

            <p> WHITNEY: <persName type="mcpherson">Jeanne</persName> knows a great, big, large lot. Jeanne came over
               to see <persName type="minter">Mary</persName> <time ref="date">a day or so after the murder</time>. She would be a good person for
               you to talk to. And her mother, <persName type="o'neil">Mrs. O'Neil</persName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Well, going back to that old subject of the gun, I just wanted to be sure
               that <persName type="shelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> had it in the <placeName type="redsidence">house</placeName> for a <time ref="duration">long
                  time</time>.</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: Oh yes, there was always a <objectName ref="gun">gun</objectName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: If anybody said that <persName type="shelby">Mrs. She1by</persName> did not know anything about a <objectName ref="gun">pistol</objectName> or
               revolver, and was afraid of one, that would not be true?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: That's ridiculous. <persName type="shelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> was not afraid of anything.</p>

               <date>the night before</date>. He said to me, "<persName ref="maigne"

               was called up, I know. <persName ref="maigne">Charley Maigne</persName> told me.</p>

               and informed her about <time ref="estimation">half an hour previous</time> to her calling me. It was

               <persName ref="minter">Miss Minter</persName>. I mean more than just to like her for a nice
               little girl. He thought more of <persName ref="normand">Miss Normand</persName> than he did of any
               one I have ever known. I got there I must have got at <persName ref="taylor">Mr.

               to <persName ref="ivers">Mrs. Ivers</persName> and then then I went right over and got them from

               which my watch says <time>quarter after 8</time>. I rung the <objectName ref="doorbell">door bell</objectName> 4 or 5 times

            <p> FELLOWS: Yes. I started away and I got about to the steps and I hesitated to see if
               I could hear him coming. As I hesitated there was no sound and I went and put the <objectName>car</objectName>

            <p> FELLOWS: I never had any occasions like that. *** as I go around I notice there is a
               light lit in his <placeName type="residence">bedroom</placeName> and a light lit in his

            <p>Disclosing that he had been a close friend of Mrs. <persName ref="cshelby">Charlotte
               Shelby</persName>, mother of <persName ref="minter">Mary Miles Minter</persName>, the latter,
               who admitted she was in love with <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> at the time of his
               slaying, <persName ref="stockdale">Stockdale</persName> had this to say yesterday: "I have expected
               the authorities to question me for some time and have made no effort to evade such
               interrogation despite the fact that no one welcomes publicity of the sort. </p>
            <p> "I was with Mrs. <persName ref="cshelby">Shelby</persName> on the night that
               <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> was murdered at about the time fixed by the
               authorities that the fatal <objectName ref="gun">bullet</objectName> was fired. That may be
               considered of importance to the authorities and is information I am quite willing to
               give." </p>
            <p><persName ref="stockdale">Stockdale</persName> indicated that he is in complete sympathy with a
               statement recently issued by Mrs. <persName ref="cshelby">Shelby</persName> in which she declared
               that, sick of the innuendoes which have followed in the wake of the
               <persName>Taylor</persName> murder, she wanted action to clear up the case once
               and for all.</p>
            
            <p>Although apparently unwilling to move at once, the <placeName>District Attorney's
               office</placeName> yesterday stated that <persName ref="stockdale">Stockdale</persName> is scheduled to be questioned
               before the present investigation is concluded.</p>
            
            <p> "I am willing to tell all I know to the District Attorney or anyone else," commented
               the actor. "I have known Mrs. <persName ref="cshelby">Shelby</persName> and her family for
               approximately twenty years. I was living on <placeName ref="street">Winona Boulevard</placeName> with my brother
               <persName ref="frank">Frank</persName>, and my mother and father on the day of the
               <eventName type="gun">shooting</eventName> of <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>. "In the evening I
               left my home and went to pay a visit to Mrs. <persName ref="cshelby">Shelby</persName> in the new
               house she had purchased at <placeName>Seventh street and New Hampshire
                  avenue</placeName>. I arrived shortly before <time>7 o'clock </time>in the evening and left
               about 9 o'clock."</p>
            
            <p><persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>, as near as authorities could fix the time, was shot
               about <time>7:45 p.m.</time> on <date>February 1, 1922</date>. Several persons in the neighborhood of his
               bungalow at <placeName type="adress">404-B South Alvarado street</placeName> reported hearing a
               shot at that time. </p>
            <p>"I was the first person," went on Stockdale, "to inform <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby </persName>that <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> had
               been killed. That was about <time>9 o'clock</time> the next morning. I had gone to the studio
               where I was working on a picture with <persName ref="normand">Mabel Normand</persName> and some one told me that <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>
               had been found dead. I telephoned Mrs. <persName ref="cshelby">Shelby</persName> at once because I
               knew that he had been <persName ref="minter">Mary's</persName> director and that the whole family
               knew him well." </p>

            <p> When a <objectName ref="gun">bullet</objectName> snuffed out the life of <persName ref="taylor">William

               <persName ref="stockdale">Carl Stockdale</persName>, veteran actor and friend of Mrs.

            <p> He appeared as a defense witness in trial of the civil suit by which <persName

               which she contends her mother removed from a joint safety deposit box.</p>
            
            <p> "I was with Mrs. <persName ref="cshelby">Shelby</persName> from <time>7:30 to 9:30 p.m.</time> in her apartment
               at <placeName ref="location">Seventh street and New Hampshire avenue the night</placeName> of the
               murder," <persName ref="stockdale">Stockdale stated.</persName>
            </p>
            <p>"I did not know of the tragedy until the following morning when I arrived for work at
               the <orgName type="studio">Mack Sennett Studios</orgName>. </p>
            <p>"I immediately called Mrs. <persName ref="cshelby">Shelby</persName> and told her to prepare
               herself for a shock. Then I told her Mr.<persName ref="taylor"> Taylor</persName> had been slain. </p>
            <p> "She screamed: 'Impossible!' "</p>
            
            <p> The actor's testimony, while perhaps not strictly pertinent to the present
               <eventName>suit</eventName>, was introduced to answer certain pointed intimations
               made during its trial, attorneys explained.</p>
            
            <p>
               <persName ref="minter">Mary Miles Minter</persName> and the late <persName ref="normand">Mabel

               <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> mystery, <persName>Stockdale</persName> said. But at
               no time had he heard rumors that Mrs. <persName ref="cshelby">Shelby</persName> might be involved
               as a suspect, he added. </p>
            
            <p> The actor also testified that he had seen Mrs. <persName ref="fillmore">Fillmore</persName> under
               the influence of <objectName ref="drink">liquor</objectName> four times between <date ref="year">1925 and 1931</date>. </p>

            <p>...<persName ref='stockdale'>Stockdale's </persName>testimony was in the nature of a reply to that of
               Mrs. <persName ref="fillmore">Fillmore</persName> two days ago when she said she did not know her
               mother's whereabouts at the hour of the murder. Cross-examined as to whether he had
               ever heard that Mrs. <persName ref="cshelby">Shelby</persName> was a suspect in the murder, the
               veteran actor replied, "I did not hear any such rumors, but I did hear rumors that

            <p> December 26, 1929 A. M. Rochlen LOS ANGELES EXAMINER</p>
            
            <p>In a remarkable interview, given exclusively to the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER, <persName
               ref="cshelby">Mrs. Charlotte Shelby</persName>, mother of <persName ref="minter"
                  >Mary Miles Minter</persName>, last night for the first time revealed hitherto
               unknown phases of <eventName type="murder">the <persName ref="taylor">William Desmond
                  Taylor</persName> murder case</eventName>. From the wealth of memories so
               closely associated with the career of <persName ref="minter">her talented
                  daughter</persName> she brought forth details that shed a new light on the many
               investigations that sought to unravel the tangled threads of the <eventName
                  type="murder">murder of the film director</eventName> -- a case famous the world
               over. "The time for action has come. I'm not going to sit idly and be a target for
               base rumors and vicious innuendo. there must be some justice in this world -- even
               for a helpless woman." Breaking a silence of more than seven eventful years,
               <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName>, one of the dramatic and
               ever-interesting figures of <eventName type="murder">the Taylor case</eventName>,
               thus struck back at the endless chain of "whispers and theories" linking her, as well
               as others, in the events of that <eventName type="murder">baffling
                  mystery</eventName>. Of <persName ref="minter">Mary Miles Minter</persName>, who
               was a film star under <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>'s direction, she had
               little to say. </p>
            
            <p>What here is disclosed would remain forever in her own <objectName type="bodyPart"
               >heart</objectName>, she said, were it not for the rumors, reports and
               insinuations that are making her life a dreadful dream. Desiring only to be left
               alone,<persName ref="cshelby"> Mrs. Shelby</persName> now feels that she must cut
               through the web of whispers and suspicions to bring to an end the repetitions of her
               name in connection with the <eventName type="murder">case</eventName>. And she wants to serve notice that every recourse
               of law will be brought to bear to stop unwarranted bantering of her name and to force
               those who have used it to come out in the open. "I have made complete statements to
               the <persName ref="police">proper authorities</persName> in the past and I stand
               ready to do it again if it will help in a sincere and honest effort to solve
               <eventName type="murder">the mystery</eventName> of <persName ref="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor's</persName> death," <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> said in
               the <eventName>interview</eventName>. "But somewhere, somehow, this thing has got to
               stop. I demand it. We cannot go through life like this -- I and my <persName
                  ref="minter">daughter</persName>, <persName ref="mshelby">Margaret</persName>. We
               are not hiding from anyone one anything. All we ask is to be left alone, and somebody
               has got to help us fight this terrible thing." For the purpose of an earnest and
               legitimate investigation, <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> revealed for
               the first time to THE EXAMINER <time>last night</time> that -- She was not in love
               with <persName ref="taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName>. She did not make
               threats against the <persName ref="taylor">famous director</persName>.</p>
            
            
            <p>She did not go to <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>'s <placeName
               type="residence">bungalow</placeName> at <placeName type="address">404B South
                  Alvarado Street</placeName> at an <time>early morning hour</time>
               <date>several weeks before the murder</date>, armed with a
               <objectName>revolver</objectName>. She did not, shortly before the murder,
               purchase a <objectName type="gun">gun</objectName> and practice with it. "I know that
               some of these things, with many vicious details added, had been whispered around,"
               Mrs. Shelby said. "How most of them originated, no one knows. Some, I'm sure, were
               spread by a person formerly in my employ. I know that person and I know the motive.
               At the proper time and place I shall make known this motive, but in the meantime I am
               interested in just this: "I want to find out who circulates these rumors. I want to
               get definite information of definite statements against me, and then I am going to
               take definite action to the limit of my ability and the law." Mrs. Shelby's
               <objectName type="bodyPart">blue eyes</objectName> lost some of their softness as
               she spoke. Only a <time>few minutes before</time> she came into the room to greet
               <persName>the visitor</persName>. Attired in a soft, clinging <objectName
                  type="clothes">Viennese gown</objectName> of golden brown, with brown suede shoes
               to match, she sat near the window of her <placeName type="residence">charming
                  apartment</placeName> in a court that looked like a corner of some far-away nook
               in old Granada. Outside Christmas crowds and <objectName type="vehicle">laden
                  automobiles</objectName> moved back and forth. <persName ref="mshelby">Margaret
                     Shelby Fillmore</persName>, always a close pal and companion of her mother, sat
               nearby. </p>

               cruel reverberations of the old Taylor case. "We arrived in <placeName type="state" subtype="california"
                  >California</placeName>
               <date>November 17</date>. For <time>more than three years</time> we lived in
               <placeName type="continent" subtype="europe">Europe</placeName>. You know, there are many things we
               do not discuss with the outside world. There are many sorrows one must always bear
               alone or with those who are very near and close. "My <persName ref="minter"
                  >daughter</persName> and I (to Mary Miles Minter, Mrs. Shelby never alluded as "my
               daughter") traveled and saw everything that was beautiful in old <placeName
                  type="continent" subtype="europe">Europe</placeName>, but now we are back -- and to all this."
               As<persName ref="cshelby"> Mrs. Shelby</persName> talked, framed against the
               <objectName>deep window</objectName> and the <objectName>dazzling white

               flashed before the <persName>interviewer</persName> another
               <eventName>occasion</eventName>, <time>almost eight years ago</time>, when
               <persName ref="cshelby"> Mrs. Shelby</persName> was an actress in a drama in which
               <persName ref="minter">Mary Miles Minter</persName> was playing the leading part.
               It was in the <placeName type="house">artistic living room</placeName> of their
               <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>, on North Hobart boulevard, in
               <date>February 1922</date>. <persName ref="taylor"> William Desmond
                  Taylor</persName>, a man of mystery and romance, a leading figure in the motion
               picture world, was <eventName type="murder">murdered in his home</eventName>
               <date>a few nights before</date>. One by one several beautiful women -- names known
               throughout the world -- were brought into the case. And <persName ref="minter">Mary
                  Miles Minter</persName>, young, vivacious, and then at the <time>height of her
                     artistic career</time>, was one of these. Mary, her face like a Greek profile of
               exquisite marble, sat on a couch and told of her last visit with Taylor -- in the
               darkened chamber of the undertaking parlors. She had gone there alone to place a
               beautiful dark red rose on the body of the man who was her director, friend, ideal.
               And Mrs. Shelby, close by, listened to the story and watched over Mary.</p>
            
            
            <p> But <time>yesterday</time>, as the brilliant <date>Christmas afternoon</date> was
               changing into <time>evening</time>, it was a different story. "Yes, I remember that
               night, <time>nearly eight years ago</time>," Mrs. Shelby replied, and paused. "I want
               to forget it. Of <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName> I shall have nothing to say.
               She is in good hands and can take care of herself, I'm sure. "In those days my whole
               life was wrapped up in her. It was my work. Now I must fight for vindication. I've
               had enough of this, and I am going to ask that they put an end to the case once and
               for all." Throughout the entire discussion <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs.
                  Shelby</persName> was careful not to express any opinion on who killed <persName
                     ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>. "<persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> is
               dead. My daughter <persName ref="mshelby">Margaret</persName> and I are still alive.
               We must be protected and not crushed by this gossip. "That's why," she continued,
               "the truth must be revealed, the truth must be spoken, the truth must be printed.</p>
            
            <p>"Of course I have heard the dastardly whisperings about me and my connection with the
               case. I have heard them all -- that I was in love with Mr. Taylor, that I owned a
               <objectName type="gun">gun</objectName> and used to practice on a target a short time before
               the murder, that I went to Mr. Taylor's <placeName type="residence"
                  >apartment</placeName> early <time>one morning</time> searching for Mr. Taylor and
               threatening him with death, that I had made many other threats, and so on and on. </p>
            
            <p>"Each and every one of these rumors and whisperings is ridiculous". </p>
            
            <p>Let us take them one by one and see," she declared.</p>
            
            <p>"I did have a <objectName>gun</objectName>."</p>
            
            <p>"It was given to me by a jeweler friend of ours in <placeName type="city" subtype="santaBarbara">Santa
               Barbara</placeName>, way back in <date>1916</date>. That was a long time
               before<persName ref="taylor"> Mr. Taylor</persName> was killed.</p>
            
            <p>"We were living in <placeName type="city" subtype="santaBarbara">Santa Barbara</placeName>. I was <persName
               ref="minter">Mary</persName>'s business manager. I had to read the stories for her
               <objectName type="possession">pictures</objectName>, work on the scenarios, watch over her
               <objectName type="clothes">clothes</objectName>, the cast, everything.</p>
            
            <p>"We lived alone. No men folks in the <placeName type="residence"
               >household</placeName>. Our friend brought the <objectName>gun</objectName> to the
               <placeName type="residence">house</placeName> one night. He said I must keep
               it.</p>
            
            <p> "'But I don't know how to use it. I never held one in my hand before,' I told him. </p>
            <p>"'Well, let's learn,' he replied."</p>
            
            <p><persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> smiled.</p>
            
            <p>"You know, this really bears a strange element of humor, now that I look back on
               it.</p>
            
            <p> "We went out to some open spaces and I took this <objectName>gun</objectName> in my
               right hand. It was a pretty little thing -- had a pearl handle and all that. I
               pointed the <objectName type="gun">gun</objectName> at something or other, shut my eyes and
               pulled hard. The thing went 'boom' and threw my arm back.</p>
            
            <p> "I did that several times in succession. That was all."</p>
            
            <p>"Still, they call it target practice."</p>
            
            <p>Mrs. Shelby said she did not remember what had become of the
               <objectName>gun</objectName>. She says she has no recollection of bringing it back
               to <placeName type="city" subtype="losAngeles">Los Angeles</placeName> when the household moved from
               <placeName type="city" subtype="santaBarbara">Santa Barbara.</placeName></p>
            
            <p> "That much for target practicing," she declared.</p>
            
            <p>"Now about that visit to <placeName>Mr. Taylor's house</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p>"To understand it, I must take you <time>back a few years</time>. I must ask you to
               keep in mind the fact that <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName> was at the height
               of her career, was making big pictures. We had been in New York. I negotiated new
               contracts. There were trips and conferences and all that. Many, many details that
               play no part here, except incidentally as they relate to the contacts made with a
               former employee for whom I sent to <placeName type="state" subtype="newNork">New York</placeName> and
               who later figured in the visit story.</p>
            
            <p>"We were back in <placeName type="state" subtype="california">California</placeName>. <persName
               ref="minter">Mary</persName>'s contract originally called for pictures to be made
               in <placeName type="state" subtype="newYork">New York</placeName>. <time>One day</time>
               <persName ref="zukor">Mr. Adolph Zukor</persName> held a conference with us. It was
               decided that climatic conditions were better out here on <placeName>the
                  Coast</placeName> for the type of picture <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName>
               was making. So we came out.</p>
            
            <p>"<persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> was <persName ref="minter"
               >Mary</persName>'s director.</p>
            
            <p>"About the time of this much-discussed visit <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName>
               bought a new <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName>. It was a big, fast roadster, and <persName
                  ref="minter">Mary</persName> liked speed. She used to go out, tearing along the
               roads at 60 and 70 miles an hour. I was her mother and it worried me --
               naturally.</p>
            
            <p>"We were living on <placeName type="residence">Fremont place</placeName>. At
               <time>that time of the year</time> there was lots of fog at nights.</p>
            
            <p>"One night <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName> did not come home to dinner. We
               waited and waited. She did not call. We began to worry. </p>

            <p>LOS ANGELES EXAMINER</p>
            
            <p> In a remarkable interview, given exclusively to the <orgName type="publishing">LOS
               ANGELES EXAMINER</orgName>, <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Charlotte
                  Shelby</persName>, mother of <persName ref="minter">Mary Miles Minter</persName>,
               <time>last night</time> for the first time revealed hitherto unknown phases of the
               <persName ref="taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName> murder case.</p>
            
            <p> From the wealth of memories so closely associated with the career of her talented
               daughter she brought forth details that shed a new light on the many investigations
               that sought to unravel the tangled threads of the murder of the film director -- a
               case famous the world over.</p>
            <p>(continued below) </p>
            <p> "Perhaps she went to dinner at <placeName type="residence">someone's
               house</placeName>, it was suggested to me. We tried to reassure ourselves of this,
               but somehow I kept worrying about getting no telephone call and about that
               <objectName type="vehicle">big, fast car</objectName> and the <placeName type="road"
                  >foggy roads</placeName>. </p>
            <p> "We began to call up persons at the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>. We
               called the <persName ref="camera crew">cameraman</persName> and the <persName
                  ref="camera crew">assistant cameraman</persName>. The <persName ref="camera crew"
                     >cameraman</persName>, a big, jolly Irishman, was a favorite of <persName
                        ref="minter">Mary's</persName>. He was married and had small children. She was
               fond of children and occasionally stopped at <placeName type="residence">his
                  house</placeName>. The <persName ref="camera crew">cameraman</persName> told us
               <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName> had not been there. No one could remember
               seeing her leave the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>. </p>
            <p> "We thought <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> perhaps would know. But we
               did not have his phone number. No one seemed to know it. </p>
            <p> "Then we remembered that <time>one day</time>
               <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName> and her grandmother, <persName
                  ref="miles">Juliette B. Miles</persName>, went to <placeName
                     type="residence"><persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName> home</placeName>
               for <eventName type="tea">tea</eventName>. </p>
            <p> "<persName ref="chauncey">Chauncey</persName>, our chauffeur, drove them, so we
               called <persName ref="chauncey">Chauncey</persName> and asked him if he knew where
               <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> lived. He said he thought he could
               find <placeName type="residence">the place</placeName> but did not know the
               address. </p>
            <p> "So we started out, <persName ref="chauncey">Chauncey</persName>, my secretary and
               <persName ref="cshelby">I</persName>. </p>
            <p> "We <eventName type="driving">drove around</eventName> and around. the chauffeur
               said he knew <placeName type="neighborhood">the neighborhood</placeName> but was not
               certain of the exact location. Finally he remembered it. We stopped at the <placeName
                  type="residence">corner of Fourth and Alvarado streets</placeName>. It was
               <time>close to midnight</time> then. </p>
            <p> "<persName ref="chauncey">Chauncey</persName> said he did not know which <placeName
               type="residence">bungalow</placeName> was <persName ref="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor's</persName>. There were a number of them," <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs.
                     Shelby</persName> went on, making a wide sweep with her <objectName
                        type="bodyPart">right arm</objectName>. "As I remember it, there were <placeName
                           type="location">some on the left, some on the right and some bungalows in the
                           back</placeName>. </p>
            <p> "I saw a <objectName type="lighting">light</objectName> burning in a <placeName
               type="house">window on the right</placeName>, so I rang the <objectName
                  type="doorbell">bell</objectName>, or knocked, I don't remember which. Some one
               answered and I asked them if they knew where <persName ref="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor</persName> lived. They pointed to <placeName type="residence">a house on
                     the left side of the court, the last one in the back</placeName>. I went there and
               rang the <objectName type="doorbell">bell</objectName>. <placeName type="residence"
                  >The house</placeName> was dark. </p>
            <p> "<persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName> voice came from the <placeName
               type="residence">second story window</placeName>. </p>
            <p> "'Who is there?' he asked." </p>
            <p> "'This is <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName>,<persName ref="taylor"> Mr.
               Taylor</persName>,' I answered. </p>
            <p> "'I'll be right down,' he replied and in a short time opened the door and asked me
               to step in. </p>
            <p> "I entered the room, a sort of combination living and dining room. <persName
               ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> showed much interest. He, too, appeared worried
               over <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName>'s absence. Then he suggested some more
               persons to call. I waited while he used the <objectName type="communication"
                  >telephone</objectName>. </p>
            <p> "I remember that he stepped into a sort of <placeName type="residence">a telephone
               room -- an out of the way nook</placeName>, and called. He talked to an assistant
               director, I think his name was <persName ref="o'connor">Frank O'Connor</persName>,
               and he called several others. None had seen <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName> or
               knew where she had gone. </p>
            <p> "By this time we both were considerably worried. </p>
            <p> "After some conversation, in which I mentioned my fears of an accident, I left." </p>
            <p> "'Be sure to call me and let me know if anything had happened,'<persName
               ref="taylor"> Mr. Taylor</persName> said as he bade me goodbye. I went to
               <placeName type="vehicle">our car</placeName>, where <persName ref="whitney"
                  >Charlotte Whitney, the secretary</persName>, waited for me, and we went
               <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>. </p>
            <p> "I do not now remember the time of this visit. It was not, as has been whispered
               around, <time>shortly before <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName>
                  murder</time>. I did not 'storm' into <placeName type="residence">the
                     house</placeName>, with a <objectName type="gun">loaded revolver</objectName>
               in hand, as has been whispered around. I did not threaten <persName ref="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor</persName>, as has been said." </p>
            <p>
               <persName ref="minter">Miss Minter</persName>, <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs.
                  Shelby</persName> said, <time>came home some time later</time>. </p>
            <p> "She never told us where she had been <time>that night</time>. We were relieved to
               learn that there had been no accident and that she was well. </p>
            <p> "But months later we learned about that trip. <persName ref="urson">Frank
               Urson</persName>, a dear friend of the family, and an old associate from Santa
               Barbara days, told me that he had run across <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName>,
               driving her <objectName type="vehicle">big roadster</objectName> at 55 miles an hour and
               that he took her in tow and finally sent her <placeName type="residence"
                  >home</placeName>. He told me he feared she would meet with an accident and warned
               us against her habit of speeding. </p>
            <p> "Certainly," <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> declared, "this incident
               is not a hot murder mystery clue. Certainly, had there been anything sinister in
               <time>that night</time> visit, I would not have taken two witnesses me or made
               public inquiry for <placeName type="residence"><persName ref="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor's</persName> residence</placeName>. </p>
            <p> "And yet," <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> went on," some one related
               this story and some one has been keeping it alive, until today it is one of the
               endless chains of clues and rumors that keep bobbing up on the least provocation. </p>
            <p> "What's more," <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> declared, this story,
               along with all sorts of others, was related to former District Attorney <persName
                  ref="keyes">Asa Keyes</persName>. </p>
            <p> "I made a complete statement to <persName ref="keyes">Mr. Keyes</persName> after he
               returned from <placeName type="state">New York</placeName>. I held back nothing. Why
               this 'mystery' should be resurrected ever so often, is beyond me." </p>
            <p> "To the world in general the <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> murder case
               brought thrills, mystery and the glamour of big names, but to others it brought
               tragedy and sorrow," she said. </p>
            <p> There was a long pause. </p>
            <p> Perhaps the hectic days of the first <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> case
               investigation were ringing through<persName ref="cshelby"> Mrs. Shelby's</persName>
               mind. Perhaps there came a train of thought that carried swiftly the amazing story of
               <persName ref="minter">Mary's</persName> rise and the events that followed her
               famous director's unexplained murder. </p>
            <p> If <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> thought about the <eventName
               type="lawsuit"><objectName type="money">$1,000,000</objectName> suit filed by her
               daughter in <time>1926</time> and of her demand for accountings, for audits and
               for return of <objectName type="money">money</objectName> earned in the
               films</eventName>, she gave no indication of this. </p>
            <p> And if the drama of that <eventName type="bodyViewing">intense recital of <persName
               ref="minter">Mary's</persName> visit to the body</eventName> of <persName
                  ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>, recalled to her <time>a few minutes before</time>,
               took her back to memories tinged with the romance of her beautiful daughter,
               <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby </persName>managed to hide her emotions. </p>
            <p> Earlier in the interview some allusion was made to <persName ref="minter">Mary Miles

               and tokens, most of them unidentified, found <placeName type="residence">in his
                  apartment</placeName>
               <time>after the murder</time>. </p>
            <p> "I'm sure, <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> was a gentleman," <persName
               ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> said. </p>
            <p> She hesitated a little, and then went on. </p>
            <p> "I'm going to rip all this innuendo wide open -- there is no other way," she went
               on. </p>
            <p> "I know that there have been reports that I was in love with <persName ref="taylor"
               >Mr. Taylor</persName> and that I was jealous of my daughter and also feared that
               <persName ref="minter">Mary's </persName>career would suffer, and that I killed
               <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> to preserve my love and <persName
                  ref="minter">Mary's</persName> film future. </p>
            <p> "I am repeating these things just to show the absurdity of them. How is it possible
               to have such a double motive? The mere repetition of it shows the absurdity of the
               whole thing. Killing <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor </persName>would have wrecked
               <persName ref="minter">Mary's</persName> career instead of saving it. </p>
            <p> "But aside from that, the whole thing is ridiculous -- and vicious. </p>
            <p> "I am a woman who has always stood alone. </p>
            <p> "I was not in love with <persName ref="taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName>. I
               was not in love with anyone. And no one was in love with me. I never held a purely
               social conversation with <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> in my life. He
               was always aloof, a man of mystery, polished, distant and reserved. </p>
            <p> "In <time>those days</time> my tasks and interests were few. I lived, talked,
               planned and worked only for <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName> and her pictures. </p>
            <p> "How utterly ridiculous, how unjust and criminal, to cast accusations of such flimsy
               nature, merely on 'clues' of such thin stuff. A crime without a motive, or reason." </p>
            <p>
               <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby's</persName> references to <persName ref="taylor"
                  >Taylor</persName> were most impersonal. In fact, she said during the interview,
               <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> himself was impersonal. </p>
            <p> She came back to the <date>night of February 1, 1922</date>, when <persName
               ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> was shot and killed <time>only a few minutes after
                  the vivacious <persName ref="normand">Mabel Normand</persName>, his dinner guest
                  <time>that night</time>, left</time>
               <placeName type="residence">the bungalow</placeName> of the man she, along with
               many others, admired. </p>
            <p> She talked of <persName ref="sands">Sands -- Edward F. Sands</persName>, the
               butler-valet of the slain director who <eventName type="robbery">robbed and flaunted
                  his employer</eventName> because he knew of his checkered past. </p>
            <p> Of the incidents leading up to and following the actual slaying of <persName
               ref="taylor">"Bill" Taylor</persName>, <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs.
                  Shelby</persName> said but little. She refused to express an opinion. And of
               <persName ref="peavey">Henry Peavey</persName>, the colored house boy and cook,
               who <eventName type="dinner">served dinner</eventName> on <time>the night of the
                  murder</time> and <time>left just before <persName ref="normand">Miss
                     Normand</persName></time>, <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> also
               had little to say. </p>
            <p> "I do not remember seeing him at the <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>
               bungalow the night I called to see <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName>," was
               all she said. </p>
            <p> "But this point seems to be overlooked generally when these vicious whispers are
               passed about," <persName ref="shelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> added. </p>
            <p> "The <time>time of the murder</time> was pretty well fixed. <persName ref="maclean"
               >Mrs. Douglas MacLean</persName>, who <eventName type="gunshot">heard the

                  bungalow</placeName>. <persName ref="maclean">Mrs. MacLean</persName> was in

               saw <persName ref="unidentified man">this man</persName> and described <persName
                  ref="unidentified man">him</persName>. </p>
            <p> "Do I answer that description?" <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName> said
               smilingly as she rose to her feet and held out her <objectName type="clothing"
                  >silk-encased arms</objectName>. </p>
            <p> "Dressed in <objectName type="clothing">men's clothes</objectName>? But why" Why
               would a woman run the extra risk of being detected by wearing <objectName
                  type="clothing">clothes</objectName> in which she at once would become
               conspicuous? </p>
            <p> "This whole affair, however, is far from a jest to us. As I have said before, I have
               made complete statements and stand ready to make them if needed and if they can be of
               any use. </p>
            <p> "But I will not remain idle and be a target. From now on I am going to seek out
               those who circulate these rumors. </p>
            <p> "I am back in <placeName type="state">California</placeName>, the land I love. I am
               not in seclusion, as has been printed, nor am I hiding from any one or anything.
               There are some things that I must reserve for the future. Some of them may hold the
               solution to the motive for the circulation of these cruel rumors." </p>
            <p>
               <persName ref="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby </persName>rose to bid her interviewer good-by. </p>
            <p> "You may add," she said smilingly, "that I will remain <placeName

            <p>NANCE: Have you formed any <eventName type="case">conclusion</eventName> whether it

               <persName ref="taylor">himself</persName>?</p>

            <p>THE CORONER: Have you any questions, gentlemen?</p>

               >revolver</objectName> found <placeName type="location">upstairs</placeName>

            <p>ZIEGLER: It was. It had five <objectName type="gun">shells</objectName> in it; it had

            <p>NANCE: Was it the same caliber <objectName type="gun">bullet</objectName> as was

            <p>NANCE: What was the number of the <objectName type="gun">bullet</objectName> that was

            <p>ZIEGLER: I understand that it was a <objectName type="gun">.38</objectName>. I
               haven't seen it.</p>
            
            <p>THE CORONER: That is all, you may be excused. That is all the <objectName type = 'evidence'>evidence</objectName> we will take in this <eventName type="case">case</eventName>. All but the

            <p>I hereby certify that I, as a <persName ref="allen">shorthand reporter</persName>,
               correctly took down in <objectName type="evidence">shorthand</objectName> the <eventName

               <persName ref="callen">Coroner's</persName>
               <eventName type="case">inquest</eventName>; that the foregoing is a full, true and
               correct copy of my <objectName type="evidence">shorthand</objectName>
               <objectName type="document">notes</objectName> and a full, true and correct statement
               of <eventName type="case">the testimony and proceedings</eventName> had at said
               <eventName type="case">inquest</eventName>. <persName ref="allen">E.M.

            <p>DETECTIVE STATEMENTS</p>
            
            <p>MR. CAHILL: We <eventName type="case">tested </eventName>that and the <objectName
               type="gun">bullet</objectName> --- the <objectName type="gun">gun</objectName> was
               not more than an inch away from <persName ref="taylor">his body</persName> and they
               couldn't possibly get that close. </p>
            <p>MR. WOOLWINE: I heard it was 2 to 4 inches.</p>
            
            <p>MR. CAHILL: No, we have got it to within an inch, the <objectName type="evidence"
               >test</objectName> shows that.</p>
            
            <p>MR. WINN: In my opinion, the <objectName type="gun">shot</objectName> that was fired
               4 inches from the <objectName type="clothing">pants</objectName> in making
               that<eventName type="case"> demonstration</eventName>, is the nearest likeness to
               the <objectName type="gun">shot</objectName> in the <objectName type="clothing"
                  >coat</objectName>. </p>
