               and called <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall's mother</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN: This was after the

               <eventName instant="false" full="yes">murder</eventName>. I said, "Please tell <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mickey</span> not to
               drive that <span xmlns="" style="color: green">green car</span> so reckless; I am so afraid that he, too, will fall into
               trouble. And she thanked me and said, "I will tell him. That is just exactly what
               I
               havebeen thinking lately myself, and I want to see you soon, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>." With that I
               thought no more about it. In fact, I didn't even think [page 14] <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> would call
               me. He had not caled me in three week or more. 1 thought no more about it and I was
               surprised the 
               <date instant="false">next day</date> to learn -- yes, 
               <date instant="false">Friday</date> -- that he had tried to get me at
               <time instant="false">five-thirty</time>. My <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">sister</span> was at our old <span xmlns="" style="color: red">home</span> where there is a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">telephone</span>. The present
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">home</span> has no <span xmlns="" style="color: green">telephone</span>, and when he happened to call there she was there.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN: At <time instant="false">five-thirty</time> of what day? </p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MINTER: 
               <date instant="false">Friday</date>; and he ea1d he ms very anxious to see me. She knew I had left and
               wass driving with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">George Scarborough</span>, and she said she didn't know what time 1 would
               be back. He said well, he wanted me to come to see him before <time instant="false">ten o'clock</time>, but after
               <time instant="false">ten o'clock</time> he would be on location. He didn't say the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Salt Lake Station</span>, but he was
               very anxious to get hold of me before <time instant="false">ten o'clock</time>. I came in after <time instant="false">ten</time> and they all
               told me l had better call <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span>; he seemed very anxious to get hold of me. I
               didn'tÂ· know where to call him; I thought possibly he would come to the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">house</span>. I
               I were you I would call him up or at 1east call <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">his mother</span> and find out where he is."
               I called the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">studio</span> and the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">night watchman</span> immediately said, "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Neilan</span> is not here;
               is this <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Minter</span>?" I said, "Yes."</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> And he said, "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Mr Neilan</span> ia at the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Salt Lake Station</span>." <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Scarborough</span> and l drove
               down there in my runabout. He was very hard at work and had been all <time instant="false">night</time>, it seemed
               he had [page 15] been working all night for four nights past. They were all just dead
               tired. <time instant="false">Night and day</time> they had been working. He finished about <time instant="false">two-thirty</time>, and then
               there were several in the party, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Gloria Swanson</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Jack Pickford</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Frank Urson</span> -- <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr
                  Frank Urson</span> is now associated with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Neilan</span> as <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">director</span> -- and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> and myself.
               We went to his <span xmlns="" style="color: red">mother's home</span> where he lives with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">his mother</span> and we tried to make <span xmlns="" style="color: green">eggs</span>
               and things. It was very amusing; we only had four <span xmlns="" style="color: green">eggs</span>, and I tried to fry two of
               them and ruined the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">things</span>, adn we didn't have enough to go around and we made so
               much noise <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">his mother</span>, who was ill <span xmlns="" style="color: red">upstairs</span>, told us we must behave ourselves.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> said, "There is only one thing to do; I have got to talk to you. We have had
               all of this foolishness, and I have got something very important to say to you, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>.
               Let's drive to the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">studio</span> where we can talk." We drove down to the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Hollywood studio</span>
               and we sat there in the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">office</span>, the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">lights</span> burning and the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">watchman</span> was there and the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">property man</span> was not around. He was outside. We talked until <time instant="false">dawn</time>; it was <time instant="false">dawn</time> when
               we came out of the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">place</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN: What were you talking about?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MINTER: About <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span> and letters <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall Neilan</span> had tried to get for me.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN: Who had tried to get for you?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MINTER: <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> had tried to get for me, which was the first inkling I knew of his
               knowledge of my <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letters</span>, that I had written any to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span>. He told me certain
               very, very [page 16]ghastly things have since been proven absolutely true. He told
               them to me in my interest, but they made me very furious at the time, and we left
               more or less in a quarrel.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN: Will you please tell us everything that he told you there?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MINTER: Yes, indeed. He first said, "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>, sit down. I have something very importnat
               to tell you." I sat down, and he said, "You know this 
               <eventName type="death" instant="false" full="yes">murder</eventName> of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill</span> is going to be
               the greatest nine-days wonder" or "nineteen-days wonder that we have ever had,
               certainly that <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Los Angeles</span> ever had. You don't know what a terrible thing it is going
               to be." I said, "Yes, I do. It is awful!" He said, "Now, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>, I tried to get your
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letters</span>" --</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN: May I interrupt you a moment? What time did you arrive at his <span xmlns="" style="color: red">studio</span>?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MINTER: We left location, he worked down at the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Salt Lake Station</span>, about <time instant="false">two-thirty
                  to a quarter to three</time>, we left there and went to his <span xmlns="" style="color: red">house</span>. How long we were there I
               couldn't say; I didn't have a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">watch</span>; I imagine we were there about an hour or maybe
               more, and then we went on down to the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">studio</span> and we stayed until <time instant="false">dawn</time>, whatever time
               that is. We then came on back to my <span xmlns="" style="color: green">house</span>. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mother</span> was waiting for us and we got out
               and explained to her. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mother</span> knew he had had a verious talk and she felt sure
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marhsall</span> would try to come to our aid. My <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">mother</span> is very fond of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Neilan</span> and the
               whole family. He said he was just dead tired. The man took his hours when hee needed
               sleep to tell me these things. He was going to be up at <time instant="false">eight o'clock</time> that morning
               and he didn't even go to bed that night. He just sat up in his clothes and went out
               to work again at <time instant="false">eight o'clock</time>. Anyway, he said, "I tried to get your <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letters</span> for
               you. You know they are a very important factor in the 
               <eventName type="case" instant="false" full="yes">case</eventName>, if they get hold of
               them." I was shocked to find that he knew of my <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letters</span>. I said that I wrote some,
               and he said something about going to a newspaper or getting hold of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">some body</span> in
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Pasadena</span> to get me the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letters</span>. That part is not clear in my mind. I think I was so
               tired at the time I couldn't understand him. I haven't seen him since or I would have
               questioned him again about the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letters</span> just what he did. He told me I should have
               received them that 
               <date instant="false">day</date>. He asked me if I had gotten them and I said, "No, I haven't
               received the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letters</span> 
               <date instant="false">today</date>." He said, "Well, I sent them to the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">studio</span>, and I believe
               the studio," the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Realart Studio</span> where I had last worked. He said, "They are in
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Charley Eyton's</span> hands now." He either said <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Charley Eyton</span> or <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Carbut</span>, but I can't
               state this acutally because I was so tired at the time I could hardly hear him and
               I
               was desperately interested to hear what he said about the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letter</span>, and I strained all
               my nerves to hear, but instead it came back and forth; it was hazy. I don't know the
               exact words he spoke. Anyway, I remember saying, "Well, there is nothing in the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letters</span> that the world can't read except that it is horribly painful to me to have
               them read my <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letters</span> to him." He said, "You loved <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Billie</span>, didn't you?" I said, "Yes,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span>, I loved him deeply and sincerely." And he said, "Did you ever want to marry
               him?" Whereupon I replied, I said, "No, no; I know it couldn't have been. It was not
               meant to be." Then we talked about -- Oh, yes. Then he said, "Now, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>, I am going
               to tell you some very important thing; they are going to hurt you, going to shock
               you, but before I say a word I want you to consider <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Billie</span> was just as crazy as a
               March hare months before his death." He said, "I am going to recite a few instances
               that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill</span> told me about, things irrelevant to you, to show he didn't do this only to
               you but to others of his very <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">best friends</span>." </p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span> were extremely good friends. I don't think they saw each
               other often, but they were most affectionately fond of each other. He said, "On
               several occasions <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill</span>" -- he spoke of him as '<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill</span>' -- "has confessed to me that --
               Oh, I am so tired I can't think how I am tryingÂ­ to say it. He came up to my <span xmlns="" style="color: red">room in
                  the club</span> one day and he said, "Oh, I know something about you, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span>, and those
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">gold-tipped cigarettes</span> I found of yours." Whereupon <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> said he replied, "Well,
               you needn't say anything, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill</span>" -- l don't know what it was, a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">cigar</span> or something of
               some personal nature that he recognized of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor's</span> at somebody's <span xmlns="" style="color: red">house</span>. I don't
               know whose <span xmlns="" style="color: red">house</span>. He said, "That makes us Elks. Don't you say anything about me, what
               I have been doing in a joking, friendly manner." <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span>, he said, suddenly stood
               up and looked at him very seriously, soberly, and said, "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span>, I am surprised at
               the things you are doing now-a-days." <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> said, "Just what do you mean by that?"
               and he said, "Why, what you said to your <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">wife</span> the other night at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Sunset Inn</span> about
               poor little <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Gloria Swanson</span>."</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> I may be getting some of those words mixed; maybe he didn't say "poor little <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Gloria
                  Swanson</span>." Maybe <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> didn't tell me that. This is my impression. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> said,
               "What do you mean?" And he said, "Don't you remember the night we were at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Sunset Inn</span>
               and you were sitting here and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Swanson</span> was sitting there and your former wife,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Gertrude Banbrick</span>, came in and said, 'Hello, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Gloria</span>, how are you?' and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Gloria</span> replied
               pleasantly, and you turned to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Gertrude Bambrick</span> and said, 'How dare you speak to this
               girl?' pointing to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Gloria</span>, the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">lady</span> he was with, 'How dare you speak to her? Don't
               you ever dare to speak to her again,'" And <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span> was telling <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall Neilan</span>.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> said he looked at him and said, "What's the matter with you, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill</span>? Are you
               drunk?" He said, I haven't had a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">drink</span>," <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span> said, and he said, "The funny part
               of it was he wasn't drunk." He couldn't detect it on his breath. "But he looked quite
               as serious and sober as I do this minute." He said, "Why, tell me what day you think
               this was." He said it was on a 
               <date instant="false">certain day</date> -- I don't know if <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> told me the
               day or not. He said, on a 
               <date instant="false">certain day</date> at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Sunset Inn</span> recently. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> said, "Why,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill</span>, at that time l I was in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">New York City</span> and was not in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Los Angeles</span> nor
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">California</span>."</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span> and he had quite a friendly argument over it, and he said, "I know it is
               so; I was there myself and heard what you said upon this greeting between those two
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">girls</span>." <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> said he thought perhaps he had lost his mind. The next day he called
               up, haVing that in mind, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Swanson</span> and he said, "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Gloria</span>, am I going crazy? Have I
               lost my mind? Do you remember of ever being at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Sunset Inn</span> with me when <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Gertrude
                  Bambrick</span> passed our <span xmlns="" style="color: red">table</span> and spoke to us pleasantly and railed at my <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">former wife</span> for
               having spoken to you pleasantly and told her not to speak to you again?" And she
               said, "What on earth are you talking about? What is this? I don't understand you,"
               And he said, "Do you ever remember seeing <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill Taylor</span> there near us at any time on
               any such occasion?" And she said, "Certainly not, !the oniy time I ever saw <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William
                  Taylor</span> at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Sunset Inn</span> was the 
               <date instant="false">night</date> I was with" -- I don't know his name, some <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">friend
                  of hers</span> -- "and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill Taylor</span> was sitting away over on the other side by the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">wall</span> and
               we were by the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">orchestra</span> on this side." He said, "Was I there?" And she said, "No.
               Don't you remember you were in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">New York</span> at the time?" He said, "That is one instance,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>, of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill</span>'s failing mind, I have never cleared that up. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill</span> and I have discussed
               it many times since, and I have always gone away puzzled, amazed, that he still stuck
               to his version of my having spoken to my <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">former wife</span> as I did. I didn't see her;
               neither <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Swanson</span> saw her on that occasion." Then he said, "On another 
               <eventName type="occasion" instant="false" full="yes">occasion</eventName>
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill</span> told me he had received a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letter</span> from <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Blanche Sweet</span>; that she told <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span>
               that she was grieved he was sick;" that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshell Neilan</span> was calling on me and she
               intended to sue him. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> said that sounded so unlike <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Sweet</span> that he went to
               her and questioned her, and he said, "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Blanche</span>, have you writtn to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill</span> lately?" She
               said, "Why, yes, I wrote him a little <span xmlns="" style="color: green">note</span> not so long ago thanking him for some
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">poinsettias</span> he sent me 
               <date instant="false">Christmas</date>." He aa1d, "Did you say anything else?" She said,
               "No, not that I can remember." He said, "Did you ever say that you regretted my going
               about with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Minter</span> and that you intended to sue me?" She said, "Perfectly
               ridiculous. What do you mean? I certainly did not say any such thing."</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> at that time said to me, "And you know <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Blanche</span> doesn't lie. She certainly
               doesn't lie; tbat is her reputation all over the world, over the picture game. I have
               heard that hundreds of times myself; I am pretty sure it is so." He said, "Now, that
               is another instance of poor <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill</span>'s insanity. Now, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>, here is the ghastly thing I
               have to tell you." He said, "One time" -- I don't know whether he said in his <span xmlns="" style="color: red">room</span> or
               the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">club</span>, he was somewhere, I think in one of his own <span xmlns="" style="color: red">rooms</span>, he, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall Nieilan</span>,
               and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Arthur Hoyt</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Cap Robinson</span> -- He said "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Cap Robinson</span>"; maybe he meant "Captain"; I
               don't know; I don't know how he is; I know <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Arthur</span> well. He said, "We were all
               standing around there talking pleasantly" -- I think he said <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Antonio Moreno</span> was
               there. He said, "We were all talking pleasantly and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span> suddenly started
               talking about you, and the talk grew finally more and more personal and finally he
               said -- and this is terrible -- 'presently he said you had been over in the last two
               weeks" -- I should say this is within at least three weeks of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span>'s 
               <eventName instant="false" full="yes">death</eventName>; I
               think <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> told me at the time, but I have forgotten the time. -- "within the
               last two weeks, that you were undressed in his <span xmlns="" style="color: red">apartments</span>; that you beseeched him for
               his love; that he resisted you, and finally persuaded you to leave his
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">apartments</span>."</p>
