            <p part="N">  DORAN:  Prior to that time, was it your habit to call on him at his residence or
               had it been your habit?</p>

               <date type="severaloccasions" instant="false">on several occasions</date> I did call upon him, though never asÂ·1ate as upon this occasion.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN:  Now, on this last occasion, whet time of the day or night was it that you

            <p part="N">MINTER:  May l tell this in my own way? </p>

            <p part="N"> MINTER:  I am glad to. I am trying to answer as I would in court and 1 don't like
               to do so. </p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN:  Just proceed, go ahead and tell it in your own way.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER:  I had gone to <span xmlns="" style="color: green">bed</span>; I hadn't seen <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr taylor</span> in 
               <date type="fivemonthsago" instant="false">five months</date> at the time -- 
               <date instant="false">three months,</date> I know; three months, and I just got to thinking about it and I decided I couldn't
               stand it any longer. I was going to go up and tell him "goodbye. I got up and dressed,
               went down to my <span xmlns="" style="color: red">grandmother's room</span> and I said, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">"Mama,</span> I am going over to say 'goodbye' to Mr taylor," and she advised me not to do it.
               She said it was too late: "Do you know it is nearly 
               <time type="12oclock" instant="false">twelve o'clock?</time>" she said. I said, "Yes, sure, but I just must do so," I said, "I realize that this
               is not the usual thing and I have never been there so late, but I must do so, Mama.
               I am going to give him a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letter</span> in whioh I have told him 'goodbye,"' She said, "All right, then, if you must. I would
               get up and go with you, but I don't feel well enough," Mama often accompanied me on
               
               <eventName type="Mary'strips" instant="false" full="yes">my trips</eventName>, which were not very many during the entire time that  i knew him. So I went over
               there and arrived at <time type="11:55" instant="false">five minutes to twelve</time>, I am strange about that, I am rather queer about that, I think of the time; every
               time I was with him I would say, "Well, this time yesterday I didn't see him and today
               I am with him," and things like that. So I <time instant="false">arrived at five minutes to twelve</time> and left at t<time type="12:40" instant="false">twenty minutes to one</time>, and-- Do you wish me to tell you all that transpired?
               </p>
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN:  Never mind about that. </p>   
            
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN:  Your <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">grandmother</span> didn't accompany you?</p>

            <p part="N">MINTER:  No, I drove myself in my little <span xmlns="" style="color: green">car</span>, little run-about.</p>

            <p part="N">DORAN:  During the three months prior to December 23d, did you ever meet him anywhere.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MINTER:  No. You mean casually or see him really to talk to? I saw him, yes. </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN:  See him and meet him, to be with him? 
               </p>
            
            <p part="N">MINTER:  No; no, indeed. I passed him at <span xmlns="" style="color: red"> Lasky Studio </span> when I go over there. Sometimes I have seen <span xmlns="" style="color: green">his car</span> go down <span xmlns="" style="color: red"> Western Avenue,</span> but I hadn't seen him to speak to in

            <p part="N"> DORAN:  As I understand it, you were sincerely in love with him?</p>

            <p part="N"> DORAN:  Did you convey that feeling to him?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER:  Absolutely.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN:  You told him, did you?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER:  Absolutely. He loved me; he told me so.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN:  Were you engaged to be married?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER:  No, we were not.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN:  
               <eventName type="timeofdeath" instant="false" full="yes">At the time of his death</eventName>, it was --</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MR. MOTT: Right there at that point you might explain about the rising sun, with
               reference to your engagement. I think that explains the attitude between both of you.
               </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER:  I don't know just which to do, whether to tell you this whole thing, go right
               along and talk. I can easily do that. </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MR. MOTT: He asked if you were engaged to him. Tell him about the "rising sun" explanation.
               </p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MINTER:  I can tell you the whole thing better without being asked.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MR. DORAN:  Yes. Go ahead. and tell us in your own way all about it.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MINTER:  I had always known that this was just
               <eventName instant="false" full="yes"> an exquisite chapter in my life</eventName> that must necessarily be a brief one: I couldn't bear to part with it; it was just
               a beautiful thing that seldom occurs in the. world today as I see it, as it is forced
               upon me. It as simply a beautiful white flame; I met <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">him</span>; I had always been a <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">reserved, very retiring young girl</span>, and he was the first man and the only man who ever embodied all the glories of manhood
               in one private body. He represented that to me. He never by look, by word or by deed
               gave me any reason to doubt any of my ideals that were placed in him absolutely. At
               the time our love first formulated he said to me, "Mary, this is not right. You are
               May and I am December, and this is not right. I know it is best that we must part."
               This was at the very beginning of it, and I said, "Of course, I don't want to do any
               immodest or bold thing; I couldn't try to withhold a person's love for me who didn't
               care for me."" I said, "I know that you are many years older than I, but I couldn't
               love anybody as I love you. I simply love you. And we did try to part, We tried it
               again and again, and then he would beoome ill. At one time I had almost resolved to
               see him no more, and he was taken ill and nobody else cared, [page 6] really cared
               whether he ate his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">dinner</span> or whether he dressed warm1y enough, whether he took care of himself, and I couldn't
               bear for him to suffer. It was not only a love of sweetheart, but I wanted to be his
               nurse. I wanted to hold his head when it was aching. I wanted him to tell me his mental
               troubles, his heart troubles, and let me soothe them away for him as I would for a
               little child. I forgot the man's age; it meant nothing to me. The only thing I wanted
               was to serve him as I would have served the Lord or a little child, and then it just
               passed away; for months at a time I wouldn't see him and I didn't know why. Finally,
               I decided there was no use; it must come to an end and I went there on the night of
               the 23d to give him this letter telling him "goodbye." I had reason to believe, in
               the awful vernacular of the day, that it was over anyway, but I went there to say
               "goodbye" myself. He said, "It is rather late, isn't it, Mary?" when he opened the
               door. I said, "Yes, but don't you realize that I had to come to see you? You know
               Mama has been sick for three months and you have been ill and I have been frightfully
               worried and you haven't even had the kindness to call me to tell me that you were
               i11 and that I must not expect to see you to tell mo that things are all right." </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">  I said, "I don't care if you don't wish to see me, because it hurts me, but it wouldn't
               have hurt one-millionth as much if you had just explained to me and not leave me in
               the dark." He said, "Mary, I couldn't help it; I couldn't help it and I can't explain
               it to you."
               Oh, I don't know! I have told this thing so many times, Mr Doran, that the words just
               - I can't tell it even as it is; I can't even express it to you as it really is. There
               is so much more to it.</p>
            
            <p part="N">
               </p>
            <p part="N">MR DORAN:   At that time, on 
               <date type="Dec23rd" instant="false">December 23d,</date> let's see, he was killed on

            <p part="N">MINTER:  Why, no one was. I had finished a picture.</p>
