            <p part="N">MINTER: Yes, and then <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> would dart away again. I

As I said to
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">him</span> in the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">car</span>, not particularly about that but about other things, about

               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Neilan</span> -- <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor's</span>, and at the time of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr

               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">death</eventName>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Harry</span> was the assistant director in <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor's</span>
               <span xmlns="" style="color: orange">companies</span> there, and he had said <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Harry</span> had been in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the
                  room</span> looking over the effects -- Just a minute. I wonder if <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Charles Maigne</span> told me this. I think <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Neilan</span> told me this, too, that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Harry</span> bad gotten the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letters</span>
               and taken <span xmlns="" style="color: green">them</span> to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Jim Vantrees</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">the camera man</span>,
               whereupon I remarked, "I will bet <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs Ivers</span> had
               them," and I think <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> said, "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Jim</span> gave <span xmlns="" style="color: green">them</span> to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Eyton</span>," and that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr
                  Eyton</span> turned some of <span xmlns="" style="color: green">them</span> over
               to the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Examiner</span>. I am so afraid l am telling
               things that are not so here, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Doran</span>; I don't mean
               to, but I couldn't get all of it. That is as clear as I can make it. Anyway, I do
               remember this part, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> said <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> heard about <span xmlns="" style="color: green">them</span>, and I
               don't know how <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> heard about <span xmlns="" style="color: green">them</span>, and that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span>
               went down, I believe, to the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Examiner</span>, to get
               ahold of <span xmlns="" style="color: green">them</span> and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> had something to do with <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Pasadena</span>, a <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">man</span>, he did tell me the man's name.
               I don't remember <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">his</span> name, but I believe it be­gan with "S", and
               this <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">man</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> said he was the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">big man</span>
               over the entire <span xmlns="" style="color: orange">Examiner force</span>, told <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">him</span> to go down and take the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letters</span>. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">He</span> said, "Of course, if
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">you</span> breathe this it wi11 just about throw
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">me</span> in jail for the rest of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">my</span> life," but I don't believe it will. Then <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> said, "Didn't <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">you</span> get
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">them</span> today?" I said, "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">I</span> did not." As well as I remember, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> said, "I then sent <span xmlns="" style="color: green">them</span> to the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Realart Studio</span> and
               they ought to be in <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Charley</span>'s hands now or
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Garbut</span>." This whole <time instant="false">Friday night</time>
               is most hasy in my recollection.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: This <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">man</span> knew before <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">you</span> were in love with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span>?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: Oh, yes.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">You</span> had told <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">him</span> that, had <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">you</span> not?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: No; in fact, I had never said to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span>
               "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">I</span> am in love with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William Desmond Taylor</span>." I never had.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: How did <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> find it out, then?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">He</span> knew about it, because <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">we</span> had been friends a long time. Before this
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> had come to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">my house</span> very despondent and said, "I think <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">I</span> will go out in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the garden</span>
               and eat wooly worms." I said, "Don't feel that way; there are plenty of us who feel
               the same way." I am certain <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> knew about
               
               <eventName type="taylorandminter" instant="false" full="yes">this thing</eventName>. I made no secret of
               
               <eventName type="taylorandminter" instant="false" full="yes">it</eventName>, but I didn't promenade it
               about.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Don't <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">you</span> have a recollection of having told

                  Neilan</span>, that you were fond of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: No. Many times I said, "I admire <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span>;

               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">He</span> knew I regarded <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">him</span> most highly.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Do you remember if <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> asked you at the time

               <time instant="false">all evening</time>. I hadn't been able to sleep and that was why I ws_ out.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">He</span> said if I didn't mind <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> would just go on back home, now that I was in safe
               hands, and get some sleep. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">He</span> was pretty near
               dead tired. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">He</span> isn't a very strong man.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: So <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Neilan</span> took <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">you</span>

               we discussed some of the things with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">mother</span>, with

            <p part="N">MINTER: No.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Did <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">you</span> say anything to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">him</span>, for instance to this effect: "Why should <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">you</span> be so concerned about <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">me</span>?

            <p part="N">MINTER: No, I did not, because at the time, when I asked <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">him</span> if <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> suspected me of

               assured me <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> didn't suspect any such thing, but
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> was very much impressed with the gravity of
               the situation. In fact, evidently <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> knew at that
               time exactly how these things were going to turn out. I mean that they would drag
               everybody's name into it; that the <span xmlns="" style="color: orange">papers</span> could
               get hold of for the notoriety of it. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">He</span> said, "This
               involves <span xmlns="" style="color: orange">picture people</span> and you know how <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Hearst</span> hates the <span xmlns="" style="color: orange">picture

            <p part="N">MINTER: I was at home reading the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">Cruise of the

                  O'Brien's stories</span> of the South Seas. It is very funny, and I laid
               there laughing all the <time instant="false">evening</time>. I was very -- right while I was laying

                  Stockdale</span>, he generally did, or maybe somebody dropped in. I don't just
               remember. Usually every evening somebody drops in. I know they were not there at the

               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">car</span>, I would move out and put it in this
