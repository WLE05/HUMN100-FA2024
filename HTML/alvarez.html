            <p part="N">STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT
               ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Section 2]</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: My last director was <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Frank Urson</span>. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr.
                  Taylor</span> so often, often made the remark to me that he wished tbat he
               were younger; he wanted to be younger. We undoubtedly would have been married today
               bnd he been younger. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">He</span> explained our not. being engaged in that
               way. I knew we never could be married; I also knew I never would love for another
               human being in the way I cared for him. So he would say, "You know,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>, to me you are the morning sun, bright, beaut1ful, and
               with the world and a futune before you, and I am the setting sun, and don't you see,
               my dear, it simply cannot be. I hope tbat doesn't give you the impression that I
               begged him to marry me. I never did in my life. I couldn't do that. I never even
               called him <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">"Billie"</span> in my life. The man was too wonderful for that. He was wonderful.
               I don't care what anybody says or what they prove against him. I knew him as the
               finest thing in the world. </p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MR MOTT: <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">He</span> as the embodyment of your ideal? </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: Yes, and I can aay now that I can't truthfully -- I don't know any of those
               ugly things which have been aaid about him. I never found him so. He was glorious
               to
               me. </p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MR DORAN: I read in the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">paper</span> where you had been
               
               <eventName type="major" instant="false" full="yes">engaged</eventName> to some other man.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: To <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Dickson</span>. That is not entirely true.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: What is his first name?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MINTER: <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Thomas Dickson</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Someone besides him, a director in the movies.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall Neilan</span>,

            <p part="N">DORAN: Yes, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall Neilan</span>. Didn't I read in the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">papers</span> that you had been engaged to him and the
               
               <eventName type="major" instant="false" full="yes">engagement</eventName> had been broken off? </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: That is not true. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Dickson</span> is the only one to whom I
               have been even remotely engaged, and that was a freak of despondency.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: What about <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall Neilan</span>? Were you engaged to him?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: No.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Had you been going with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall Neilan</span> during, say the

            <p part="N">DORAN: Had you been out anywhere with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">him</span>? </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: Yes; he had been to see me; I had been out with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">him</span>; I
               am not sure whether it was within the 
               <date instant="false">thirty days</date> or not, but in the
               
               <date instant="false">last two months</date>, yes sir; but going with him no more than I had for
               years off and on. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Neilan's</span> traits [page 9] are well known; he
               comes to see you, and we are always glad to receive him, but we never know how long
               he is going to stay with us or how long he was going to stay with this one or that
               one. He flits here and there like a swallow. We are all charmed with his personality,
               but don't take him seriously. </p>
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Has <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> proposed to you?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: Must I answer that? Yes, he did.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Do you recall approximately when it was?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: About 
               <date instant="false">two months ago</date>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: That would take it to 
               <date instant="false">December 1st</date>, approximately or in the
               middle of December?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: Well, I think it was after that, Yes -- No, let me see, 
               <date instant="false">December
                  1st</date> -- I wish I could tell you.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: With reference to this 
               <date instant="false">December 23d</date> that you called on <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>,
               when was it?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: It as before the 
               <date instant="false">1st of December</date>, I think.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Q. Before the

            <p part="N">MINTER: Yes; about the

            <p part="N">DORAN: And you, of course, rejected im, I suppose?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: Yes; that is, I didn't exactly say, "No, I will not marry you." I didn't take
               him seriously. I joked with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">him</span> at the time.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Did <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> seem to be serious?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: You never know. I couldn't say whether ee was serious or not. I thought
               possibly he was joking, or had a few <span xmlns="" style="color: green">cocktails</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: How many times after that did <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> mention the subject to
               you?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: He didn't mention the subject. "May I marry you" again; he didn't say that,
               but he has been on very friendly terms with me and then suddenly go away to
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">San Francisco</span>. and I wouldn't hear from him and I would
               remark, "Isn't that just like <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall?</span>" and thought no more of
               it. </p>
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Well, but along toward the last 
               <date instant="false">thirty days</date> prior to

               <eventName type="major" instant="false" full="yes">death</eventName>, he seemed to be quite devoted to you, did
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> not?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: No; I can't really say that he did. As for being with him, wasn't with
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">him</span> very much.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Didn't you observe in him some jealousy?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: Oh, no; No, I can't say that. He was not jealous of me. He is the least
               jealous man I ever met. He takes life too much -- </p>
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Did <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> ever say anything to you about
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: Yes, we have discussed him many times; he loved him. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall
                  Neilan</span> loved <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Did he ever bring any tales to you for which <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> was supposed to have been

            <p part="N">MINTER: Not until recently.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: When was that?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: 
               <date instant="false">Last Friday night</date>; whereupon we had a severe quarrel. I didn't

            <p part="N">MINTER: No; after.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Did he ever say anything like that to you <time instant="false">before</time> the

            <p part="N">MINTER: No, indeed he did not; he knew that I loved <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span>
               and he had known it.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Did he ever comment on that relation between you and

            <p part="N">MINTER: No, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> did not; I wouldn't have permitted him to; and I didn't comment on
               his.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: I will use the word "quarrel," but that may be exaggerated; did you ever
               
               <eventName type="fight" instant="false" full="yes">quarrel</eventName> with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Neilan</span> over <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>? </p>
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: Absolutely not; absolutely not. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> is the
               typification of the happy-go-lucky Irish spirit and tempera­ment. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">He</span> does perfectly
               terrible things to everybody, but everybody loves him. They are always glad to see
               him again. As to harboring any deep-seated malice, I don't believe <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> is capable of
               it. </p>
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Could he have assumed at any time you and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span>, you and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall Neilan</span> -- I am
               speaking of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall Neilan</span> now -- Could he have assumed at any time that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">he</span> might be
               or was engaged to you by reason of your relations wtth him? </p>
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: Could <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall Neilan</span> have assumed that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Taylor</span> and I were engaged?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: No, no; that you and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall Neilan</span> were enqaged?</p>

            <p part="N">MINTER: Not in my own knowledge. If I have, it was more or less of a joking way. I
               think I have at times said, "Well, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span>, when are we going all around the world
               on our honey-moon?" exactly in the same manner as I took him to say, "Now, when you
               are my wedded bride we will do" so-and­-so. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Marshall</span> has done that time after time. </p>
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: Might he not have taken you seriously? </p>

            <p part="N">MINTER: I can't truthfully answer "Yes" or "no" to that, beoause I don't know; I am
               not sure enough of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr Neilan's</span> nature. While I have known him a great many years,
               well, I will say I have known him 
               <date instant="false">several years</date>, he is the type who flits back and
               forth, you know. - When you really think you know him he turns to something else,
               and
               I don't know, so I have never permitted myself to form any conclusions on his
               character; I don't know whether he has ever taken me seriously or not. I always
               treated <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">him</span> more or less in a joking manner. </p>
