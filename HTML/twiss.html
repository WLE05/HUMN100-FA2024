            <p part="N"> It was divulged that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Carl Stockdale</span>, veteran
               character actor and close friend of Mrs. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Charlotte
                  Shelby</span>, mother of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary Miles Minter</span>,
               screen star who collapsed at news of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor's</span> death, had
               admitted that he was in the company of Mrs. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Shelby</span> at the time
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> is believed to have been murdered.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Stockdale</span>, interviewed at his home, <span xmlns="" style="color: red">6325 Fountain
                  Avenue</span>, chuckled when asked for his own conclusions on the long
               unsolved murder.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> "So <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Fitts</span> thinks I killed <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William
                  Desmond Taylor</span>," he remarked. "I'll tell you this, I was never in
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Bill Taylor's</span> <span xmlns="" style="color: red">home</span>. I met him at a

               identity, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Stockdale</span> promptly answered,
               "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Sands.</span>" He referred to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor's</span>
               one-time chauffeur [sic], <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Edward Sands</span>, whose
               mysterious disappearance immediately after the murder and before authorities could
               question him, has caused his name to be listed among those "wanted for questioning"
               by <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">police</span>. The veteran actor, now 63, declared he was with Mrs. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Charlotte
                  Shelby</span> at her home the 
               <eventName instant="false" full="yes">night was murdered</eventName>
               February 1, 1922. He fixed the time of his 
               <eventName instant="false" full="yes">visit</eventName> from 7 to 9
               p.m. Police have set the hour of the shooting at <time instant="false">7:45 p.m.</time> "I told my brother,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Frank</span>," <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Stockdale</span> said, "that I was
               droppin' in on Mrs. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Shelby</span> that night." </p>
            
            <p part="N">
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Stockdale</span> said he first met Mrs. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Shelby</span> in

            <p part="N"> While authorities deferred definite action yesterday in the investigation into the
               fifteen-year-old murder of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William Desmond Taylor</span>, a 63-year-old
               film character actor stepped forward to make the most important statement to be added
               recently to the mazes of <span xmlns="" style="color: red">California's</span> most famous murder
               mystery. The new figure in the case is <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Carl Stockdale</span>, for years
               well known as an actor in Hollywood and who now lives at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">6325 Fountain
                  Avenue</span>. </p>
            
            <p part="N">Disclosing that he had been a close friend of Mrs. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Charlotte
                  Shelby</span>, mother of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary Miles Minter</span>, the latter,
               who admitted she was in love with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> at the time of his
               slaying, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Stockdale</span> had this to say yesterday: "I have expected
               the authorities to question me for some time and have made no effort to evade such
               interrogation despite the fact that no one welcomes publicity of the sort. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I was with Mrs. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Shelby</span> on the night that
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> was murdered at about the time fixed by the
               authorities that the fatal <span xmlns="" style="color: green">bullet</span> was fired. That may be
               considered of importance to the authorities and is information I am quite willing
               to
               give." </p>
            
            <p part="N"><span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Stockdale</span> indicated that he is in complete sympathy with a
               statement recently issued by Mrs. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Shelby</span> in which she declared
               that, sick of the innuendoes which have followed in the wake of the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> murder, she wanted action to clear up the case once
               and for all.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">Although apparently unwilling to move at once, the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">District Attorney's
                  office</span> yesterday stated that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Stockdale</span> is scheduled to be questioned
               before the present investigation is concluded.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> "I am willing to tell all I know to the District Attorney or anyone else," commented
               the actor. "I have known Mrs. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Shelby</span> and her family for
               approximately twenty years. I was living on <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Winona Boulevard</span> with my brother
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Frank</span>, and my mother and father on the day of the
               
               <eventName type="gun" instant="false" full="yes">shooting</eventName> of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>. "In the evening I
               left my home and went to pay a visit to Mrs. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Shelby</span> in the new
               house she had purchased at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Seventh street and New Hampshire
                  avenue</span>. I arrived shortly before <time instant="false">7 o'clock </time>in the evening and left
               about 9 o'clock."</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"><span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>, as near as authorities could fix the time, was shot
               about <time instant="false">7:45 p.m.</time> on 
               <date instant="false">February 1, 1922</date>. Several persons in the neighborhood of his
               bungalow at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">404-B South Alvarado street</span> reported hearing a
               shot at that time. </p>
            
            <p part="N">"I was the first person," went on Stockdale, "to inform <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby </span>that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> had
               been killed. That was about <time instant="false">9 o'clock</time> the next morning. I had gone to the studio
               where I was working on a picture with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mabel Normand</span> and some one told me that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>
               had been found dead. I telephoned Mrs. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Shelby</span> at once because I
               knew that he had been <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary's</span> director and that the whole family
               knew him well." </p>
