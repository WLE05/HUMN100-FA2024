               minutes to get ready. We sat down I should judge <time instant="false">10 minutes after 7</time>. We
               sat there and I guess it took a half hour to eat dinner.</p>

               and I went in the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">front room</span> and got my house

               the noise or explosion, it sounded like a shot. (Speaking of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr.

               Was it disarranged at all?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MACLEAN: No, not at a11. He looked immaculate.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: How was he lying?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">MACLEAN: He was lying flat on his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">back</span>, his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">feet</span> separated a little, his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">legs</span> apart

            <p part="N">POLICE: Why is <span xmlns="" style="color: green">coat</span> appeared to be arranged you may say,

            <p part="N">MACLEAN: Yes, he was perfect.</p>

            <p part="N">MACLEAN: I suppose it could be possible but it doesn't seem to me that he was <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">the boy
