            <p part="N">...<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span>, who married <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William Cunningham Deane-Tanner</span>, or <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William
                  Desmond Taylor</span>, as he was later known, in 
               <date instant="false">1902</date>, said her former husband had
               spent some time on a <span xmlns="" style="color: red">pony ranch</span> in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">southwestern</span> <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Kansas</span> before <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">she</span> met him in
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">New York</span>.  The only information she had ever had was that which <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Deane-Tanner</span>
               gave her personally.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Deane-Tanner</span> told me that when he arrived here from <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Ireland</span> he had
               gone out to this <span xmlns="" style="color: red">ranch</span>," <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> said, "and his family in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Ireland</span> had
               
               <eventName type="investment" instant="false" full="yes">bought</eventName> for him a part interest in it.  When I met him he referred to it and
               told me a flaw in the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">title</span> had forced several of the shareholders,
               including <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">himself</span>, to give up their part, and he then joined the <span xmlns="" style="color: orange">Davenport
                  road company</span>.  After the failure of his venture in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Kansas</span> he returned to his
               home in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Ireland</span> for a visit.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"With reference to the claim of this <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">California</span> that he
               is the son of the murdered <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">director</span>, I would not like to say flatly that the
               claim is or is not true, for I knew little of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Deane-Tanner's</span> life on the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">ranch</span> in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Kansas</span> and did not find it necessary to catechize him minutely, and
               he never mentioned anything to me about having been married out there.
               Perhaps there is some truth in the story, or it may be another of the many
               persons who come forward whenever there is an <span xmlns="" style="color: green">estate</span> to be settled.  I have
               been interested in the number of persons who claim <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Deane-Tanner</span>, or
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>, was their father.  To date he must have had at least six or seven
               children besides my own daughter, if the stories are all correct.  As <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr.
                  Deane-Tanner</span> would only be about <time instant="false">fifty years</time> old now, that is rather
               ridiculous, I think."</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> Referring to the criminal end of the case, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> criticized the
               work of the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Los Angeles</span> detectives and prosecutors, saying they do not seem
               to be particularly anxious to solve the mystery of the identity of the
               murderer.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">I</span> have bitterly resented the accounts printed in some of the
               newspapers here that my daughter and myself are merely interested in the
               financial part of the affair and are more interested in the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> <span xmlns="" style="color: green">estate</span>
               than in the identity of the person who killed my former husband.  This is
               absolutely untrue, for, as <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor's</span> former wife, I am deeply grieved at
               this terrible affair and am anxious to see the guilty person punished."
               Returning to the discussion of the claim of the man who says the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">movie
                  director</span> was his <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">father</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> said that it seemed improbable that her
               first husband ever used the name of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> before he left <span xmlns="" style="color: red">New York</span> in 
               <date instant="false">1908</date>.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">She</span> said that to old friends who knew him when he first came to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">this country</span>
               and had been in constant touch with him during his stay in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Kansas</span> nothing
               was known of any marriage while he was in the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">West</span>.  After that, and until
               he 
               <eventName type="leaving" instant="false" full="yes">disappeared</eventName>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> said, he never used the name of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>, or
               referred extensively to his visit to the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">ranch</span> in the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">West</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"I never really knew <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Deane-Tanner's</span> right age," <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> said,
               "and I understood that he had been in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">his country</span> about eight or nine years,
               when I 
               <eventName type="marriage" instant="false" full="yes">married</eventName> him at the <span xmlns="" style="color: orange">Little Church Around the Corner</span> in 
               <date instant="false">1901</date>.  He was a
               fine, lovable man, and I never had occasion to closely question him about
               his 'past,' which every one seems trying to 
               <eventName type="investigation" instant="false" full="yes">dig up</eventName>."</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">No decision whether <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> or her daughter, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Ethel</span>, will go to
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">California</span> in connection with the settling of the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">estate</span> has been reached.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Frank E. Schrenseisen</span> of <span xmlns="" style="color: red">New Rochelle</span>, attorney for <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Tanner</span>, said that
               he was awaiting developments and instructions from the office of the Public
               
               <title type="politician">Administrator</title> in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Los Angeles</span>.  Another attorney for <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Tanner</span> has been
               engaged in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Los Angeles</span>.  Should the 
               <title type="politician">Public Administrator</title> place credence in
               the story of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>, it is probable that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Tanner</span> will accompany her
               attorney to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the coast</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Deane-Tanner</span> told my <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">daughter</span> that he had made a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">will</span> in her
               favor," <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> said, "and had placed it in his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">safe deposit box</span>.  I
               understand that this is another one of the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">items</span> which the <span xmlns="" style="color: orange">police</span> say have
               strangely '
               <eventName type="disapearnce" instant="false" full="yes">disappeared</eventName>.'  What he did with it I have no idea, but I feel
               that the entire matter will be straightened out.  Just at present I am
               hoping that the murderer of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> will be brought to justice for this
               terrible crime."</p>

            <p part="N">Curiously enough, (and one reason why <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> is increasingly
               inclined to the opinion that her husband's sudden 
               <eventName type="abandon" instant="false" full="yes">disappearance</eventName> from <span xmlns="" style="color: red">New
                  York</span> was due to loss of memory), her former husband never mentioned her in
               the letters.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">Another reason for this belief, she declared, was that on the times she
               and her <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">daughter</span> lunched here with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>--after it was definitely
               established that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> was in reality <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Deane-Tanner</span>--he never mentioned the
               fact that he 
               <eventName type="abandon" instant="false" full="yes">deserted</eventName> his <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">wife</span> and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">daughter</span>.  On these occasions all three
               felt the subject was rather delicate and it was never brought up.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> said that when <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">she</span> and her <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">daughter</span> became convinced 
               <date instant="false">two
                  years ago</date>, after seeing pictures of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>, that he was the girl's father,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Deane-Tanner</span> took the initiative and wrote to him.  His reply came
               <time instant="false">immediately</time>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">In it he said he was very glad to hear from her; that he had not heard
               from he for so <time instant="false">long</time> that he thought <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">she</span> was dead.  This is one more reason
               why <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> believes her former <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">husband</span> was a victim of aphasia when he
               left, after attending the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Vanderbilt</span> cup races in 
               <date instant="false">1908</date>.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> also, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> asserted, was unable to recall friends of
               their married life, and when their names were mentioned, his face failed to
               show the slightest signs of remembrance.  He did remember, however, favorite
               dishes of his former wife when he was dining with his daughter, pointing
               them out to the latter on the menu during their luncheon together.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> declared that these points proved that his mind, while
               vague as to consequential facts about <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">her</span> married life with the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">director</span>,
               retained minor details.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> The director's experiences in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Alaska</span> also were set forth in one <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letter</span>.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> told of how he contracted scurvy, consequently suffering from loss of
               hair, headaches and neuralgia.  Another letter dismissed with a few scornful
               words <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Sands</span>, his chauffeur, who is still being sought by <span xmlns="" style="color: orange">police</span>.  The
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">director</span> declared <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Sands</span> had upset his home and said his name had been forged
               to checks by his unfaithful servant.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">Signatures <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> used in his letters to his <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">daughter</span>, for whom he
               showed deep devotion, were "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Father</span>" and "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Daddy Pete</span>."  The origin of how
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> came to be known as "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Pete</span>" was explained by <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span>.  She said
               when <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>, or as he was known then, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Deane-Tanner</span>, first came to live in
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">New York</span> he took lodging with several Englishmen.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"><span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>, always deliberate and calculating in his methods, was nicknamed
               "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">P. D. Q.</span>," by his roommates, which was quickly shortened to "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Pete</span>."
               The <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">director's</span> promise to leave his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">estate</span> to his <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">daughter</span> was
               contained in a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">letter</span> written in 
               <date instant="false">February, 1920</date>.  <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Robins</span> said her
               former husband said in this message he thought it would be good policy to
               leave them both an <span xmlns="" style="color: green">annuity</span>, in addition to telling of his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">will</span> bequeathing
