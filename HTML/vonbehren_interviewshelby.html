            <p part="N"> December 26, 1929 A. M. Rochlen LOS ANGELES EXAMINER</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">In a remarkable interview, given exclusively to the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Charlotte Shelby</span>, mother of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary Miles Minter</span>, last night for the first time revealed hitherto
               unknown phases of 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William Desmond
                     Taylor</span> murder case</eventName>. From the wealth of memories so
               closely associated with the career of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">her talented
                  daughter</span> she brought forth details that shed a new light on the many
               investigations that sought to unravel the tangled threads of the 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">murder of the film director</eventName> -- a case famous the world
               over. "The time for action has come. I'm not going to sit idly and be a target for
               base rumors and vicious innuendo. there must be some justice in this world -- even
               for a helpless woman." Breaking a silence of more than seven eventful years,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span>, one of the dramatic and
               ever-interesting figures of 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">the Taylor case</eventName>,
               thus struck back at the endless chain of "whispers and theories" linking her, as well
               as others, in the events of that 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">baffling
                  mystery</eventName>. Of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary Miles Minter</span>, who
               was a film star under <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>'s direction, she had
               little to say. </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">What here is disclosed would remain forever in her own <span xmlns="" style="color: green">heart</span>, she said, were it not for the rumors, reports and
               insinuations that are making her life a dreadful dream. Desiring only to be left
               alone,<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Mrs. Shelby</span> now feels that she must cut
               through the web of whispers and suspicions to bring to an end the repetitions of her
               name in connection with the 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">case</eventName>. And she wants to serve notice that every recourse
               of law will be brought to bear to stop unwarranted bantering of her name and to force
               those who have used it to come out in the open. "I have made complete statements to
               the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">proper authorities</span> in the past and I stand
               ready to do it again if it will help in a sincere and honest effort to solve
               
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">the mystery</eventName> of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr.
                  Taylor's</span> death," <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span> said in
               the 
               <eventName instant="false" full="yes">interview</eventName>. "But somewhere, somehow, this thing has got to
               stop. I demand it. We cannot go through life like this -- I and my <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">daughter</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Margaret</span>. We
               are not hiding from anyone one anything. All we ask is to be left alone, and somebody
               has got to help us fight this terrible thing." For the purpose of an earnest and
               legitimate investigation, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span> revealed for
               the first time to THE EXAMINER <time instant="false">last night</time> that -- She was not in love
               with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William Desmond Taylor</span>. She did not make
               threats against the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">famous director</span>.</p>
            
            
            
            <p part="N">She did not go to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>'s <span xmlns="" style="color: red">bungalow</span> at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">404B South
                  Alvarado Street</span> at an <time instant="false">early morning hour</time>
               
               <date instant="false">several weeks before the murder</date>, armed with a
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">revolver</span>. She did not, shortly before the murder,
               purchase a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">gun</span> and practice with it. "I know that
               some of these things, with many vicious details added, had been whispered around,"
               Mrs. Shelby said. "How most of them originated, no one knows. Some, I'm sure, were
               spread by a person formerly in my employ. I know that person and I know the motive.
               At the proper time and place I shall make known this motive, but in the meantime I
               am
               interested in just this: "I want to find out who circulates these rumors. I want to
               get definite information of definite statements against me, and then I am going to
               take definite action to the limit of my ability and the law." Mrs. Shelby's
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">blue eyes</span> lost some of their softness as
               she spoke. Only a <time instant="false">few minutes before</time> she came into the room to greet
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">the visitor</span>. Attired in a soft, clinging <span xmlns="" style="color: green">Viennese gown</span> of golden brown, with brown suede shoes
               to match, she sat near the window of her <span xmlns="" style="color: red">charming
                  apartment</span> in a court that looked like a corner of some far-away nook
               in old Granada. Outside Christmas crowds and <span xmlns="" style="color: green">laden
                  automobiles</span> moved back and forth. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Margaret
                  Shelby Fillmore</span>, always a close pal and companion of her mother, sat
               nearby. </p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> The two had but recently returned from <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Europe</span>. <span xmlns="" style="color: red">France</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Belgium</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Germany</span>,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Switzerland</span> and <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Italy</span>. <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Paris</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: red">London</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Vienna</span> -- art
               museums and <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Florence</span> -- and then all the crash and
               cruel reverberations of the old Taylor case. "We arrived in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">California</span>
               
               <date instant="false">November 17</date>. For <time instant="false">more than three years</time> we lived in
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Europe</span>. You know, there are many things we
               do not discuss with the outside world. There are many sorrows one must always bear
               alone or with those who are very near and close. "My <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">daughter</span> and I (to Mary Miles Minter, Mrs. Shelby never alluded as "my
               daughter") traveled and saw everything that was beautiful in old <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Europe</span>, but now we are back -- and to all this."
               As<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Mrs. Shelby</span> talked, framed against the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">deep window</span> and the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">dazzling white
                  walls</span> of the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">courtyard</span>, there
               flashed before the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">interviewer</span> another
               
               <eventName instant="false" full="yes">occasion</eventName>, <time instant="false">almost eight years ago</time>, when
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Mrs. Shelby</span> was an actress in a drama in which
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary Miles Minter</span> was playing the leading part.
               It was in the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">artistic living room</span> of their
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">home</span>, on North Hobart boulevard, in
               
               <date instant="false">February 1922</date>. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> William Desmond
                  Taylor</span>, a man of mystery and romance, a leading figure in the motion
               picture world, was 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">murdered in his home</eventName>
               
               <date instant="false">a few nights before</date>. One by one several beautiful women -- names known
               throughout the world -- were brought into the case. And <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary
                  Miles Minter</span>, young, vivacious, and then at the <time instant="false">height of her
                  artistic career</time>, was one of these. Mary, her face like a Greek profile of
               exquisite marble, sat on a couch and told of her last visit with Taylor -- in the
               darkened chamber of the undertaking parlors. She had gone there alone to place a
               beautiful dark red rose on the body of the man who was her director, friend, ideal.
               And Mrs. Shelby, close by, listened to the story and watched over Mary.</p>
            
            
            
            <p part="N"> But <time instant="false">yesterday</time>, as the brilliant 
               <date instant="false">Christmas afternoon</date> was
               changing into <time instant="false">evening</time>, it was a different story. "Yes, I remember that
               night, <time instant="false">nearly eight years ago</time>," Mrs. Shelby replied, and paused. "I want
               to forget it. Of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> I shall have nothing to say.
               She is in good hands and can take care of herself, I'm sure. "In those days my whole
               life was wrapped up in her. It was my work. Now I must fight for vindication. I've
               had enough of this, and I am going to ask that they put an end to the case once and
               for all." Throughout the entire discussion <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs.
                  Shelby</span> was careful not to express any opinion on who killed <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>. "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> is
               dead. My daughter <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Margaret</span> and I are still alive.
               We must be protected and not crushed by this gossip. "That's why," she continued,
               "the truth must be revealed, the truth must be spoken, the truth must be printed.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"Of course I have heard the dastardly whisperings about me and my connection with
               the
               case. I have heard them all -- that I was in love with Mr. Taylor, that I owned a
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">gun</span> and used to practice on a target a short time before
               the murder, that I went to Mr. Taylor's <span xmlns="" style="color: red">apartment</span> early <time instant="false">one morning</time> searching for Mr. Taylor and
               threatening him with death, that I had made many other threats, and so on and on.
               </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"Each and every one of these rumors and whisperings is ridiculous". </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">Let us take them one by one and see," she declared.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"I did have a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">gun</span>."</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"It was given to me by a jeweler friend of ours in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Santa
                  Barbara</span>, way back in 
               <date instant="false">1916</date>. That was a long time
               before<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Mr. Taylor</span> was killed.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"We were living in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Santa Barbara</span>. I was <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>'s business manager. I had to read the stories for her
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">pictures</span>, work on the scenarios, watch over her
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">clothes</span>, the cast, everything.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"We lived alone. No men folks in the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">household</span>. Our friend brought the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">gun</span> to the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">house</span> one night. He said I must keep
               it.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> "'But I don't know how to use it. I never held one in my hand before,' I told him.
               </p>
            
            <p part="N">"'Well, let's learn,' he replied."</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"><span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span> smiled.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"You know, this really bears a strange element of humor, now that I look back on
               it.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> "We went out to some open spaces and I took this <span xmlns="" style="color: green">gun</span> in my
               right hand. It was a pretty little thing -- had a pearl handle and all that. I
               pointed the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">gun</span> at something or other, shut my eyes and
               pulled hard. The thing went 'boom' and threw my arm back.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> "I did that several times in succession. That was all."</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"Still, they call it target practice."</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">Mrs. Shelby said she did not remember what had become of the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">gun</span>. She says she has no recollection of bringing it back
               to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Los Angeles</span> when the household moved from
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Santa Barbara.</span></p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> "That much for target practicing," she declared.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"Now about that visit to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Mr. Taylor's house</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"To understand it, I must take you <time instant="false">back a few years</time>. I must ask you to
               keep in mind the fact that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> was at the height
               of her career, was making big pictures. We had been in New York. I negotiated new
               contracts. There were trips and conferences and all that. Many, many details that
               play no part here, except incidentally as they relate to the contacts made with a
               former employee for whom I sent to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">New York</span> and
               who later figured in the visit story.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"We were back in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">California</span>. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>'s contract originally called for pictures to be made
               in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">New York</span>. <time instant="false">One day</time>
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Adolph Zukor</span> held a conference with us. It was
               decided that climatic conditions were better out here on <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the
                  Coast</span> for the type of picture <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>
               was making. So we came out.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> was <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>'s director.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"About the time of this much-discussed visit <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>
               bought a new <span xmlns="" style="color: green">car</span>. It was a big, fast roadster, and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> liked speed. She used to go out, tearing along the
               roads at 60 and 70 miles an hour. I was her mother and it worried me --
               naturally.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"We were living on <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Fremont place</span>. At
               <time instant="false">that time of the year</time> there was lots of fog at nights.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"One night <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> did not come home to dinner. We
               waited and waited. She did not call. We began to worry. </p>
