            <p part="N"> In a remarkable interview, given exclusively to the <span xmlns="" style="color: orange">LOS
                  ANGELES EXAMINER</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Charlotte
                  Shelby</span>, mother of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary Miles Minter</span>,
               <time instant="false">last night</time> for the first time revealed hitherto unknown phases of the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William Desmond Taylor</span> murder case.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> From the wealth of memories so closely associated with the career of her talented
               daughter she brought forth details that shed a new light on the many investigations
               that sought to unravel the tangled threads of the murder of the film director -- a
               case famous the world over.</p>
            
            <p part="N">(continued below) </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "Perhaps she went to dinner at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">someone's
                  house</span>, it was suggested to me. We tried to reassure ourselves of this,
               but somehow I kept worrying about getting no telephone call and about that
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">big, fast car</span> and the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">foggy roads</span>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "We began to call up persons at the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">studio</span>. We
               called the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">cameraman</span> and the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">assistant cameraman</span>. The <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">cameraman</span>, a big, jolly Irishman, was a favorite of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary's</span>. He was married and had small children. She was
               fond of children and occasionally stopped at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">his
                  house</span>. The <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">cameraman</span> told us
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> had not been there. No one could remember
               seeing her leave the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">studio</span>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "We thought <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> perhaps would know. But we
               did not have his phone number. No one seemed to know it. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "Then we remembered that <time instant="false">one day</time>
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> and her grandmother, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Juliette B. Miles</span>, went to <span xmlns="" style="color: red"><span style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor's</span> home</span>
               for 
               <eventName type="tea" instant="false" full="yes">tea</eventName>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Chauncey</span>, our chauffeur, drove them, so we
               called <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Chauncey</span> and asked him if he knew where
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> lived. He said he thought he could
               find <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the place</span> but did not know the
               address. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "So we started out, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Chauncey</span>, my secretary and
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">I</span>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "We 
               <eventName type="driving" instant="false" full="yes">drove around</eventName> and around. the chauffeur
               said he knew <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the neighborhood</span> but was not
               certain of the exact location. Finally he remembered it. We stopped at the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">corner of Fourth and Alvarado streets</span>. It was
               <time instant="false">close to midnight</time> then. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Chauncey</span> said he did not know which <span xmlns="" style="color: red">bungalow</span> was <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr.
                  Taylor's</span>. There were a number of them," <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs.
                  Shelby</span> went on, making a wide sweep with her <span xmlns="" style="color: green">right arm</span>. "As I remember it, there were <span xmlns="" style="color: red">some on the left, some on the right and some bungalows in the
                  back</span>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I saw a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">light</span> burning in a <span xmlns="" style="color: red">window on the right</span>, so I rang the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">bell</span>, or knocked, I don't remember which. Some one
               answered and I asked them if they knew where <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr.
                  Taylor</span> lived. They pointed to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">a house on
                  the left side of the court, the last one in the back</span>. I went there and
               rang the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">bell</span>. <span xmlns="" style="color: red">The house</span> was dark. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor's</span> voice came from the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">second story window</span>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "'Who is there?' he asked." </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "'This is <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span>,<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Mr.
                  Taylor</span>,' I answered. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "'I'll be right down,' he replied and in a short time opened the door and asked me
               to step in. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I entered the room, a sort of combination living and dining room. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> showed much interest. He, too, appeared worried
               over <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>'s absence. Then he suggested some more
               persons to call. I waited while he used the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">telephone</span>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I remember that he stepped into a sort of <span xmlns="" style="color: red">a telephone
                  room -- an out of the way nook</span>, and called. He talked to an assistant
               director, I think his name was <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Frank O'Connor</span>,
               and he called several others. None had seen <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> or
               knew where she had gone. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "By this time we both were considerably worried. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "After some conversation, in which I mentioned my fears of an accident, I left."
               </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "'Be sure to call me and let me know if anything had happened,'<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Mr. Taylor</span> said as he bade me goodbye. I went to
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">our car</span>, where <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Charlotte Whitney, the secretary</span>, waited for me, and we went
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">home</span>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I do not now remember the time of this visit. It was not, as has been whispered
               around, <time instant="false">shortly before <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor's</span>
                  murder</time>. I did not 'storm' into <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the
                  house</span>, with a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">loaded revolver</span>
               in hand, as has been whispered around. I did not threaten <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr.
                  Taylor</span>, as has been said." </p>
            
            <p part="N">
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Minter</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs.
                  Shelby</span> said, <time instant="false">came home some time later</time>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "She never told us where she had been <time instant="false">that night</time>. We were relieved to
               learn that there had been no accident and that she was well. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "But months later we learned about that trip. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Frank
                  Urson</span>, a dear friend of the family, and an old associate from Santa
               Barbara days, told me that he had run across <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span>,
               driving her <span xmlns="" style="color: green">big roadster</span> at 55 miles an hour and
               that he took her in tow and finally sent her <span xmlns="" style="color: red">home</span>. He told me he feared she would meet with an accident and warned
               us against her habit of speeding. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "Certainly," <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span> declared, "this incident
               is not a hot murder mystery clue. Certainly, had there been anything sinister in
               <time instant="false">that night</time> visit, I would not have taken two witnesses me or made
               public inquiry for <span xmlns="" style="color: red"><span style="color: blue;">Mr.
                     Taylor's</span> residence</span>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "And yet," <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span> went on," some one related
               this story and some one has been keeping it alive, until today it is one of the
               endless chains of clues and rumors that keep bobbing up on the least provocation.
               </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "What's more," <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span> declared, this story,
               along with all sorts of others, was related to former District Attorney <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Asa Keyes</span>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I made a complete statement to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Keyes</span> after he
               returned from <span xmlns="" style="color: red">New York</span>. I held back nothing. Why
               this 'mystery' should be resurrected ever so often, is beyond me." </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "To the world in general the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> murder case
               brought thrills, mystery and the glamour of big names, but to others it brought
               tragedy and sorrow," she said. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> There was a long pause. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> Perhaps the hectic days of the first <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> case
               investigation were ringing through<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Mrs. Shelby's</span>
               mind. Perhaps there came a train of thought that carried swiftly the amazing story
               of
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary's</span> rise and the events that followed her
               famous director's unexplained murder. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> If <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span> thought about the 
               <eventName type="lawsuit" instant="false" full="yes"><span xmlns="" style="color: green">$1,000,000</span> suit filed by her
                  daughter in <time instant="false">1926</time> and of her demand for accountings, for audits and
                  for return of <span xmlns="" style="color: green">money</span> earned in the
                  films</eventName>, she gave no indication of this. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> And if the drama of that 
               <eventName type="bodyViewing" instant="false" full="yes">intense recital of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary's</span> visit to the body</eventName> of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span>, recalled to her <time instant="false">a few minutes before</time>,
               took her back to memories tinged with the romance of her beautiful daughter,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby </span>managed to hide her emotions. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> Earlier in the interview some allusion was made to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary Miles
                  Minter's</span> glowing account of the slain director and to the love letters
               and tokens, most of them unidentified, found <span xmlns="" style="color: red">in his
                  apartment</span>
               <time instant="false">after the murder</time>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I'm sure, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> was a gentleman," <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span> said. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> She hesitated a little, and then went on. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I'm going to rip all this innuendo wide open -- there is no other way," she went
               on. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I know that there have been reports that I was in love with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> and that I was jealous of my daughter and also feared that
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary's </span>career would suffer, and that I killed
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> to preserve my love and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary's</span> film future. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I am repeating these things just to show the absurdity of them. How is it possible
               to have such a double motive? The mere repetition of it shows the absurdity of the
               whole thing. Killing <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor </span>would have wrecked
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary's</span> career instead of saving it. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "But aside from that, the whole thing is ridiculous -- and vicious. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I am a woman who has always stood alone. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I was not in love with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William Desmond Taylor</span>. I
               was not in love with anyone. And no one was in love with me. I never held a purely
               social conversation with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> in my life. He
               was always aloof, a man of mystery, polished, distant and reserved. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "In <time instant="false">those days</time> my tasks and interests were few. I lived, talked,
               planned and worked only for <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> and her pictures. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "How utterly ridiculous, how unjust and criminal, to cast accusations of such flimsy
               nature, merely on 'clues' of such thin stuff. A crime without a motive, or reason."

            <p part="N">
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby's</span> references to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> were most impersonal. In fact, she said during the interview,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> himself was impersonal. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> She came back to the
