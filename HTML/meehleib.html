               February 5, 1922
               NEW YORK HERALD
               William Desmond Taylor, the slain movie director, was well known in
               this city in 1908.  But he was not known as Taylor.  He was William
               Cunningham Deane-Tanner, expert in antiques in those days, and he moved in
               good society, was well supplied with money from a mysterious source in
               Ireland and eventually was married to Ethel May Harrison of one of the
               Floradora Sextettes.
               Without a word of explanation, according to the woman who was then his
               wife, he disappeared in 1908.  The first Mrs. Deane-Tanner now is the wife
               of E. L. C. Robins, owner of Robins Restaurant and other hostelries.  Mrs.
               Robins gave out a statement yesterday explaining her marriage and the
               desertion and her subsequent discovery that her former husband had popped up
               in the motion picture colony at Hollywood, Cal., and became famous the world
               over as William Desmond Taylor.  She says his murder shocked her and the
               daughter he abandoned.
               "I married, in December, 1901, Mr. William Cunningham Deane-Tanner of
               Dublin, Ireland," the statement said.  "He disappeared in October, 1908.  We
               could assign no reason for his disappearance except possibly aphasia.
               "In 1912 I got a decree of divorce in the State of New York and was
               awarded the custody of my only child, Ethel Daisy Deane-Tanner, now 19.
               "In August, 1914, I married Edward L. C. Robins.  Two and a half weeks
               later I discovered that William Desmond Taylor had been Mr. Deane-Tanner.
               I have no further statement which possibly could be of interest.
               "The news of Mr. Deane-Tanner's death was a great shock to my daughter
               and me."
               At her home in Orienta Point, Mamaroneck, last night, Mrs. Robins said
               she held no resentment for the way Deane-Tanner treated her.  She presented
               excuses for him, saying he suffered lapses of memory during the time they
               lived together and that not long before he vanished, in 1908, he was
               stricken with facial neuralgia and frequently was in an agony of pain.  She
               does not believe he knew what he was doing the morning he left their home
               and she supposes that a mental ailment can be held to account for his
               failure to return.
               Just as dramatic as were many of the chapters in Deane-Tanner, or
               William Desmond Taylor's, life was Mrs. Robins's discovery in 1919 that he
               was still living.
               With her daughter Mrs. Robins went to a motion picture theater in this
               city one night.  They chose the theater without knowing what picture it was
               featuring.  For several hundred feet of film it was just a new picture as
               far as they were concerned, but suddenly the hero appeared.  Mrs. Robins
               sank back in her seat too startled to speak.  He daughter stood up.
               For the laughing face on the screen was that of the long missing Deane-
               Tanner a little changed--somewhat older looking they decided when they
               finally settled back to wait for the hero's next entry.  They sat through
               the picture and then saw it again and learned that the man whose face they
               knew was acting and directing movies under the name of William Desmond
               Taylor.
               Mrs. Robins said last night that her daughter would not be satisfied
               until she had written to Taylor.  Taylor answered her letter and the two
               continued a correspondence which grew with each month until finally Taylor
               of the movies came back to New York to try to make some amends for his
               conduct as Deane-Tanner, the negligent father.
               Taylor never explained why he had changed his name.  But Mrs. Robins
               said he met her and the daughter on at least one occasion and expressed a
               desire to try to make good for his failure.  He spent money lavishly on the
               girl, giving money and other presents to her and encouraging her to study.
               The love of the beautiful in art that appears to have impressed his
               Hollywood friends cropped up in his talks with his daughter, and he
               ultimately prevailed upon her to enter an art school in this city.  She is
               now studying there.
               Mrs. Robins emphatically denied that her former husband ever married
               after he deserted her.  She said she met him last August and remembers
               distinctly that he said he never had remarried and never would.  His
               daughter, she quoted him as saying, was the only pal he wanted.
               According to Mrs. Robins, Deane-Tanner was of a family well known in
               Ireland--listed among the landed gentry or the peers, she wasn't sure which.
               His father was a Major in the British army, and he came of a line of men
               whose names have figured in British history.
               She said he was prepared for the army at one of the great British
               universities--Oxford or Cambridge--and that he was about to start for the
               military school when his health failed.  He was sent to the United States,
               he told her, so that he might recover.  Mrs. Robins said she remembers that
               he told her once he had two sisters and one brother, and she met soon after
               their marriage a man she supposes was the brother.
               The stories of drugs and drinking, Mrs. Robins thinks, are untrue,
               because while Deane-Tanner was her husband he used liquor but sparingly and
               always criticized those who did not know how to handle it.
               Before her marriage to Taylor--or Deane-Tanner, as he called himself
               then--Mrs. Robins was Miss Ethel May Harrison.  No one could be found who
               could explain fully Deane-Tanner's early movements in New York, but it was
               established that he came from Ireland with considerable money and a habit of
               spending it freely.  He caused some attention in sporting circles, talked
               about his yachts abroad, and eventually, it was said, became a familiar
               figure on the float of the Larchmont Yacht Club.  He made friends easily and
               held them.  Suddenly he began talking of previous visits here, and it was
               said yesterday, by men who knew him but do not want their names coupled with
               his in the murder mystery, that he let it be known he had played in roles
               opposite Fanny Davenport.
               Mrs. Robins would not say where she and her first husband made their
               home or where they were living when he disappeared, but it was established
               through friends that he dropped out of sight in 1908 a few weeks after the
               Vanderbilt cup races.

               February 6, 1922
               NEW YORK DAILY NEWS
               Edward L. C. Robins, owner of Delmonico's, who married Mrs. Ethel
               Hamilton Deane Tanner after she had divorced the romantic Irishman whose
               murder has stirred the continent, knew Tanner well and met Mrs. Tanner--now
               Mrs. Robins--through that friendship.
               But Mr. Robins has not the slightest idea of how Tanner--known to
               Hollywood and the movie world as William Desmond Taylor--came to be
               murdered.  Talking with a representative of the Daily News at his home in
               Mamaroneck last night, Mr. Robins said:
               "I can't see why the newspapers are paying so much attention to
               Mamaroneck.  It seems to me they ought to be trying to solve this mystery
               out in Los Angeles, where it happened.
               "I knew 'Pete,' as we called him, long before Mrs. Tanner and I were
               married.  Pictures of him now?  Ethel, have we any pictures of Pete?"
               Mrs. Robins had been listening in an alcove.  When called she appeared
               promptly.  A tall, striking blonde, with big, wide-open eyes, she did not
               impress one as the carefree girl who twenty years ago played in the
               Floradora company.
               "No," she answered.  "I destroyed all those pictures when we got
               married.  There might be one or two in the old trunks upstairs, but I doubt
               it.  Every one I found I tore up long ago."
               With just that much interest is the murder of the man who was her
               husband accepted by Mrs. Robins.  She divorced him ten years ago, under
               curious circumstances, after he had gone out of her life four years before.
               Apparently his sudden and unexpected going out from his own life has made
               only the slightest impression upon Mrs. Robins.
               But behind all this insouciance there looms some extraordinary mystery.
               Mrs. Robins cannot imagine any reason why her former husband was shot down
               in cold blood in his quiet home at Hollywood last Wednesday night.  But she
               is not surprised, astonished, amazed or--to be brutally frank--very much
               horror-stricken.
               ...Mrs. Robins said last night that shortly after their marriage she
               and Tanner visited his folks in Ireland.  They were entertained royally and
               she realized for the first time that the young blood she had married off
               Broadway was a veritable sportsman in Ireland.  His family entertained her
               at their home in Fitzwilliam Square and afterward they paid a visit to Cork,
               where the old family seat was located.
               "They were the Deane Tanners," Mrs. Robins explained, "to differentiate
               them from the other Tanners.  The name is rather a familiar one in Ireland,
               and in England I think it is rather derogatorily applied to some small coin,
               a six-pence, I think.  His father had been a member of Parliament; his uncle
               was a justice of the peace.  Altogether the family was quite to the
               front."...
