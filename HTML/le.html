            <p part="N"> POLICE: During the time in the east there, when he (Taylor) was directing her
               (Mary), did you observe any awakening of a friendship or love between the two of
               them?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: No.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: When did you first see that, or did you at all?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: I never did know it, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Keyes</span>, until <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Mott</span> told
               me of the letters that had been found in Taylor's <span xmlns="" style="color: red">drawer</span> that
               absolutely is convincing that there had been something there.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: You mean after he was killed</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: Yes, and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Eyton</span> told me also after <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span>
               was killed that he knew that, that he knew for a long time that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr.
                  Taylor</span> had been intimate, and I said then "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Mr. Eyton</span> you
               should have told me."</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: During that time. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span> (referring to latter part of 1919
               and early part of 1920), was Mary going around with Taylor to your knowledge at
               all?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: Why no, and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> was the most perfectly poised man, such a
               proper man. He would take Mary out to 
               <name type="event" full="yes" instant="false">dinner</name> and he would invariably invite me and my
               mother to go to dinner with them.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Did you make any objections?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: Not the least in the world.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Were you friendly with him?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: Oh, yes. ***</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Do you remember anyone in particular with whom she was associating at that
               time?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: It wasn't men. Men hadn't begun to give me any trouble at that time. It was
               women.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Who was that?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Jeannie McPherson</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Taylor's name never entered into 
               <name type="conversation" full="yes" instant="false">the discussion</name> then?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: No. I always felt that, when <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> was out with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr.
                  Taylor</span> she was under a good influence. ***</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Did you ever have any words with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> over

            <p part="N">SHELBY: Never a word, never the slightest word. (Speaking of the time <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs.
                  Shelby</span> went to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Taylor's home</span> at 2 a.m. looking for
               
               <name full="yes" instant="false">Mary</name>).</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Did this secretary of yours, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Whitney</span>, go in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the

            <p part="N">SHELBY: No, I know she didn‚Äôt because there was nobody in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the
                  room</span> but <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> and me. She stayed in the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">car.</span></p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Did you have any weapon with you at that time?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> SHELBY: Good lord, no.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: You are sure you didn't have <span xmlns="" style="color: green">a revolver</span> with
               you?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: No, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Keyes</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Well, you owned <span xmlns="" style="color: green">a revolver</span> at that time?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: No. If I owned <span xmlns="" style="color: green">a revolver</span> at that time, I don‚Äôt
               know where it was. It was thrown away.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: What date was it when you were at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Mr. Taylor's home</span> that you were telling
               about?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: I think I could almost fix that date,<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Mr. Keyes</span>, referring to
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">a certain little book</span>, you know. Because I was reading
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">Mary's diary</span> and she goes on to say in this
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">diary</span> that she and I had some little words that evening,
               you see, and she has written it very clearly, about the small girl going out in a
               huff, etc., and she adds that mother was right. **** And I think the date of that
               happeningis right in her diary.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Did you ever make a threat to kill<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Mr. Taylor</span></p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: No, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Keyes</span>. I never had any reason or desire to kill
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: And you are positive, are you, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span>, that you never at
               any time threatened <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span>?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: Certainly not, I had no reason. I never threatened to shot <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr.
                  Taylor</span>. I don't think I ever threatened to shoot any man. To shoot him? No,
               because I had no reason. I had no provocation. I never had a quarrel with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr.
                  Taylor</span> in my life.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: You spoke of having thrown <span xmlns="" style="color: green">a gun</span> away?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: No, my mother did that.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: That was your gun?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: Yes. It was <span xmlns="" style="color: green">a gun</span> I used once. I shot it once and
               once was enough.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: How long had you had <span xmlns="" style="color: green">the gun</span>?</p>

            <p part="N">POLICE: Where did you say you shot it once?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: I got a friend of mine to take me out in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Santa
                  Barbara</span>, just off the road, and we shot it into a bank and I shot it
               once.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Did you ever do any target practice with it?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: Yes, that one time. It was enough for me. The thing was too short. I can
               shoot a long pistol. I wouldn‚Äôt mind shooting <span xmlns="" style="color: green">a shot gun</span>. ***</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Well, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> shot that

            <p part="N">SHELBY: Yes, she shot it off twice.</p>

               But she ran up the stairs and ran in my room and closed the door.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Did she lock <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the door</span>?</p>

               and - bang ‚Äì the second shot. **** The chauffeur (<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Chauncey Eaton</span>)
               appeared, and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">the night watchman</span> (?), and I said "Break in the door" The two men
               rushed against the door, the door fell in, and there lay <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> on my bedroom floor ***
               They picked her up so tenderly, and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Chauncey</span> turned her over and he said, "Why,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span>, there is no blood on her." **** By that time the
               secretary had faded out of the picture in a faint *** and she (<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby's mother</span>,
               Mrs. Miles) said, "Why no, she is not shot; stand her up, Chauncey." *** Then she

               anything to that? I told you I shot it once. I know a man who will verify it -

                  telephone</span> rang again and the inevitable Miss Berger again. *** I
               said, "Oh, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Margery</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Stockdale</span> just telephoned me from
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the studio</span> that 
               <name ref="Taylor" full="yes" instant="false">Mr. Taylor</name> was found dead this
               morning." **** In a few minutes <span xmlns="" style="color: green">the telephone</span> rang again.
               *** This time <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Berger</span> said, "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William Desmond Taylor</span> was
               murdered this morning. He was shot." I said, "Oh, my, this is terrible; the man was
               murdered," Was shot? So we discussed that and the organ man knew I was waiting to
               go
               out with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Rice</span> so ** <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Rice</span> and I got in his car *** and I said, ‚ÄúMr. Rice, do
               you mind if I stop at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">my house</span> and tell my people?" *** and it seems to me that on
               the way crossing <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Vermont</span> met my mother coming over in a car with the chauffeur and I
               just waved to her to turn around and come on back with us. I remember that
               distinctly. ***** I was in a great hurry because <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Rice</span> was waiting
               for me in front, and I remember the chauffeur had parked <span xmlns="" style="color: green">my blue Packard</span> in the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">driveway</span>, and something was said about Mary wanted <span xmlns="" style="color: green">the car</span>.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Chauncey</span> had gone to get <span xmlns="" style="color: green">Mary's car</span>. However, I went
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">upstairs</span> in a great hurry, and I said, "Oh,
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Julia</span>, dear, Mr. Taylor was murdered last night." She said, "Oh, it
               isn't possible. I can't believe it. It isn't true." I said, "Oh, yes, it is.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Berger</span> told me so." *****</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Did <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Woolwine</span> ever try to take your statement?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">SHELBY: No, he never asked me a thing, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Keyes</span>. Nobody ever questioned

            <p part="N">SHELBY: I said "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Chauncey</span>, what did you tell them?" He said, "I told them
               that you called me up very early that morning, about half past seven, and my wife
               said you went ever there without breakfast; that you wanted to go over to
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the Hobart house</span>." I said, "The morning of the Taylor
               murder." He said, "Yes." I said, "Why, I couldn't have known until after 9
               o‚Äôclock.‚Äù He said that he drove me over that morning and said that I was at the
               wisdom with <span xmlns="" style="color: green">the papers</span> I said, "How could that be; besides there wasn't any <span xmlns="" style="color: green">papers</span>
               that morning." "No," he said, "that's what they told me down at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the
                  office</span>, that there wasn‚Äôt any papers that early." I said, "Well,
               that's nothing, it is just a laps of memory, it is of no consequence." And finally
               he
               saw he was in the wrong. I explained to him that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Rice</span> had driven me
               over."</p>

               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">her car</span> in front of <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Charlotte Whitney's house</span>) So <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Margaret</span> and I rushed in and went up the steps
               hurriedly and opened <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the door</span> and came upon Mary &amp; Monte (Blue) on the couch. The
               door opened right into the front room. This Monte Blue started to run out into <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the
                  kitchen</span> and out <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the back door</span>.</p>

            <p part="N">SHELBY: Yes. I was about the maddest woman that could ever be. I grabbed this
