            <p part="N">EYTON: Well, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor's</span> assistant <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">[Harry
                  Fellows]</span> rang me up at my residence about, I should
               judge, <time instant="false">eight o'clock</time>, and told me <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> had died
               suddenly; so I immediately went over to his residence, and he
               was lying on the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">floor</span> on his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">back</span>.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Detective Ziegler</span> was there and he had called the doctor, he told me,
               previous to my arrival; and the doctor told me <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> had died from
               hemorrhage of the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">stomach</span>. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Maclean - Douglas
                  Maclean</span> - had told me that he had thought he had heard <span xmlns="" style="color: green">a
                  shot</span>
               
               <date instant="false">the night before</date>, and his wife also thought she had heard <span xmlns="" style="color: green">a
                  shot</span> - and he wanted the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">body</span> turned over;
               they didn't want to turn it over until the coroner came. The <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">deputy coroner</span> came
               after a while, and he told us he had died of hemorrhage of the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">stomach</span>, and I told him he had better turn the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">body</span> over to make sure, and he put his
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">hand</span> under <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor's</span>
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">body</span>, and found a little - when he pulled his
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">hand</span> out, it had a little <span xmlns="" style="color: green">blood</span>
               on his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">hand</span>. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Douglas</span> asked him what that was,
               and he said it evidently had run down from his <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">[Taylor's]</span>
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">mouth</span>, but I noticed that there was no <span xmlns="" style="color: green">trail of
                  blood</span>-<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor's</span>
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">head</span> was in a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">pool of blood</span> - there
               was no <span xmlns="" style="color: green">trail of blood</span> running down. </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">NANCE: There was a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">pool of blood</span> under his

            <p part="N">EYTON: Under his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">head</span>, yes, a little

                  Taylor's</span>
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">vest</span>, and looked, and looked on the right-hand side, and
               there was no mark. I looked on the left-hand side and saw some
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">blood</span>, and then I told the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Deputy Coroner</span>
               that I thought that evidence enough to turn his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">body</span> over to
               see what would happen. I sent for a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">pillow</span> to put under
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor's</span>
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">head</span>, and we turned him over - the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Deputy
                  Coroner</span> and myself - and we pulled his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">shirt</span> and
               his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">vest</span> up, and we found the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">bullet
                  wound</span>. </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">NANCE: <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Eyton</span>, was his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">body</span>
               stone cold at that time?</p>

               that is the way it looked. It didn't show evidence in the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">room</span>
               when I got there- neither the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">room</span> or the
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">body</span> showed any evidence of a struggle. He had on the
