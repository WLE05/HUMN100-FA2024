            <p part="N">
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Julia Crawford Ivers</span> was closely associated with
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Taylor</span> for over six years and wrote the
               scenarios for most of his <span xmlns="" style="color: orange">Paramount</span> films. After
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Taylor's </span> murder, her career soon faded.</p>
            
            <p part="N"><span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">When Mary Miles Minter</span> was interrogated by Deputy
               District Attorney William Doran<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"></span>, on February 7, 1922, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Minter</span> recalled a conversation with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Marshall Neilan</span> in which <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Minter</span>
               stated that the only person she could think of who might have killed <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Taylor</span> was <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"> Julia Crawford
                  Ivers</span>. But <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Ivers</span> was never seriously
               considered a suspect.</p>
            
            <p part="N">Reticent and shy of personal publicity, she gave very few interviews throughout her
               career. [17] The following are some isolated exceptions:</p>

               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">scenario department</span>, a lady who occupies a
               large and closely written page in the "Who's Who and Why, and What and When, and

            <p part="N"><span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Ivers</span> says she has done almost everything
               around a <span xmlns="" style="color: red">studio</span> but sweep <span xmlns="" style="color: green">the floor</span>. She was six years at the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Morosco studio</span> before coming to the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Lasky plant</span>, where she held every position from film
               cutter and editor to superintendent of the plant. [<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Ivers</span> also directed several films.] <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss
                  Ivers</span> has a large number of original stories and adaptations to her
               credit, including Tom Sawyer, Huck and Tom, The Furnace, The Soul of Youth, two
               stories as yet unnamed to be produced by <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary Miles
                  Minter</span>, and The Witching Hour, now being made by <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William D. Taylor</span>; and in addition to this, she has published
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">stories and articles </span>in many of the
               leading <span xmlns="" style="color: green">magazines</span>. She is a person of
               decided opinions as to the writer and his relation to the finished film.</p>
            
            <p part="N"> "The writer is only a helper," she says, "and sometimes very poor help. More stories
               have been spoiled than made by writers who tried to put them in <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span> form, and if many of the writers who are
               yelping for credit on the screen should be debited with the lack of imagination and
               lack of vision they display, they would have no more to say."</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p part="N"> February 7, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Julia Crawford

               are legion, will gather to pay the last tribute to the man they love, to one who as
               man, director and friend measured 100 per cent. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I have worked side by side with this man for seven years. We have solved many
               difficult problems together, sometimes pleasant, sometimes unpleasant: always hard,
               trying nerve-wracking. And during all these years of close association I have never
               known him to do one unkind, one ungenerous act, but I have known hundreds of
               instances of open-handed generosity and in most cases the beneficiary never knew whom
               to thank.</p>
            
            <p part="N">"This man whose loyalty and honor were without question, who takes with him the
               undying gratitude of the thousands to whom he has lent a helping hand--this man who
               stood for everything that was fine and clean in <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span>, who is known to have declared that if it were necessary to
               his success to produce unclean <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span> he
               would go back to the white, clean snows of <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Alaska</span>
               and dig his living out of the ground--this man was shot in the back by a cowardly
               assassin. He was given no opportunity to defend himself and <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William D. Taylor</span> would have defended himself, for he did not know the
               meaning of the word fear. And more cowardly than the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">assassin's bullet</span>, lodged in<span xmlns="" style="color: green"> the
                  heart</span> of this dear man, is the tongue of scandal, which safely
               sheltered behind his <span xmlns="" style="color: green">dead body</span>, is striking at
               his reputation--more cowardly for he is powerless to defend himself.</p>
            
            <p part="N">"His friends know that when it is all over the character of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> will stand, as it always has stood, for everything that is

            <p part="N"><span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Ivers</span> arrived on the Matsonia from <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Los Angeles</span>, accompanied by her secretary, Miss
               Aldrich<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"></span>, and although here but three days, she is already delving deep
               into legends and also the history of <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Hawaii</span>,
               particularly that relating to old feudal <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Hawaii</span>.</p>

               folk acquainted with legends, and her observations, will lead her into the path that
               will eventually open out into the appropriate theme, she does not know, but she has
               hopes.</p>
            
            <p part="N">To further acquaint herself with <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the Islands</span> and to
               absorb the atmosphere of old and new <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Hawaii</span>, she
               will visit <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Kauai</span> next week, leaving here Monday or
               Tuesday night and remaining a few days on the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Garden
                  Island</span>.</p>
            
            <p part="N">The following week she will go to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Hilo</span>, taking her
               car, and will motor over to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Kalapana</span>, all through
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Puna</span>, thence to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the

               where she will learn all she can of <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Kealakekua Bay</span>,
               the scene of Captain Cook's<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"></span> discovery and tragedy; the city of refuge at
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Honaunau</span> and may possibly go into <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Kohala</span>, which abounds in historic wealth.</p>
            
            <p part="N"><span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Ivers</span> says she has been a scenario writer with
               the <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Lasky</span> interest for about eight years and during
               seven years of that time was closely associated in motion <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span> production with <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">William D. Taylor</span>, whose tragic death caused a temporary suspension of
               much work planned.</p>
            
            <p part="N">"<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Taylor</span> was a splendid <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span> director," said <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss
                  Ivers</span>. "He was a man of fine attainments. He was sympathetic and those
               who worked with and under his direction regarded him as one with whom it was a
               pleasure to be associated.</p>
            
            <p part="N">"My own work as a scenario writer was pleasurable from the fact that there was
               co-operation. He wanted the best and we desired to give him only the best. He was
               a
               credit to the motion <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span> service and
               will be a loss to it, for he was of a constructive type, doing the best with the
               highest class of material."</p>
            
            <p part="N">It was partly because of his death that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Ivers</span>
               dropped her own activities for a time, superinduced by a cold, resulting in the end
               in a determination to visit <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Hawaii</span>, with
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Lasky's</span> injunction that she delve into
               Hawaiian legends and find whether any of them can be filmed.</p>
            
            <p part="N"><span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Ivers</span> is at the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Seaside
                  hotel</span>. She makes no promises, but is reading much about Hawaii. She is
               dictating morning and afternoon. She is going here and there where details of
               Hawaiian life may be learned.</p>
            
            <p part="N">If such a motion <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span>play is to be
               written it may not deal entirely with legends, but legends may be woven into a modern
               type of play. The story of the Goddess Pele<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"></span>, who dwells in <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Kilauea volcano</span>, has attracted much of her attention and
               her own visit to the volcano in a week or so will have that much more interest for
               her. There is a dramatic, tragic, firey element in Pele<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"></span> which may be
               converted to the screen, in her opinion.</p>
            
            <p part="N"> Much of <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Ivers'</span> work at the studio in Los
               Angeles is associated directly with literary folk, writers of <span xmlns="" style="color: green">books</span> whose names are known throughout the reading
               world--<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Sir Gilbert Parker</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Sydney [sic] Maugham</span>, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Elinor
                  Glyn</span> and many others. It is <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Ivers</span>
               who takes their <span xmlns="" style="color: green">books</span> and prepares or
               directs the preparation of scenarios for the director.</p>
            
            <p part="N">It is this contact between the scenario writer and the authors that counts for
               success or failure in the motion <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span>
               product. If the scenario writer is sympathetic and endeavors to get the soul of the
               author's intent, there are exceptional possibilities. If not, there is more likely
               to
               be a failure in the interpretation.</p>
            
            <p part="N"> Many <span xmlns="" style="color: green">books</span> to be screened must be ripped
               to pieces. As the story is written it can seldom be filmed. The change is the task
               of
               the scenario writer.</p>
            
            <p part="N">Life must have been lived by scenario writers to really interpret a story for the
               screen for the eyes of the millions of theater patrons. Phases of life that are near
               the raw edge of actuality and realism may not be interpreted by the old maid who has
               not seen life and whose first impulse, and probably her last, is to eliminate that
               particular phase. A man of sensual thought may regard that particular phase as one
               to
               work into a maudlin interpretation which would be offensive.</p>
            
            <p part="N"> Between these two extremes there is the middle course and that path must be taken
               by
               the writer who understands life and understands the multiplicity of types and
               characters that patronize the theaters.</p>
            
            <p part="N">
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Ivers</span> is a hard worker. She maintains high
               ideals as to <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span> production. Hers is a
               constant study of human nature. Philosophy and psychology are tangible factors with
               her, for both play important parts in decisions as to the worth of stories and the
               filmed product.</p>
            
            <p part="N">"I must necessarily write in dashes where authors employ sentences and paragraphs,"
               said <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Miss Ivers</span> discussing her method of writing. "I
               cull and cut, where book writers must enlarge and pad."</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p part="N"> October 3, 1922 HONOLULU STAR-BULLETIN A dramatic love story with all the gripping
               beauty of the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Hawaiian islands</span> as a background is
               what <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Julia Crawford Ivers</span>, scenario writer and
               director for the <span xmlns="" style="color: orange">Lasky corporation</span>, has come to
               <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Honolulu </span>to film.</p>
            
            <p part="N"> The beaches, mountains, gardens and palm trees of <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Oahu
                  </span>and <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Hawaii</span> are to provide the setting
               for the story, which <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Ivers</span> says could be
               produced nowhere else in the world. "I wrote the scenario here," she told a
               representative of the Star-Bulletin at <span xmlns="" style="color: red"> the Moana</span>
               today, "and this is the only spot in the universe where it can be filmed as it should
               be. It is imbued with the breath of <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the islands</span>.
               When I returned to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Los Angeles </span>after my visit here
               last spring, at which time I gathered material for the scenario, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Lasky</span> asked me if the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span> could not be produced on <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the
                  mainland</span>. 'I'll read you the story,' I replied, and I did. He had
               nothing more to say, and here we are ready to work.</p>
            
            <p part="N">While the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span> was not planned with the
               specific idea of giving publicity to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">the islands</span>,
               it still will be of tremendous benefit in portraying to mainland people the marvels
               of this section of the globe. It will be a true mirror in which those of the outer
               world may see life as it is lived in the Paradise of the Pacific.</p>
            
            <p part="N"> "I wrote the story," <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Ivers</span> said, "with a
               genuine love and affection for the islands, and I will produce it in the same way.
               No
               'roughneck' of a director will have a chance to squeeze the fragrance out of the
               plot, for I am going to direct the action myself. It is some time since I did that
               sort of work, but I have chosen my cast and staff myself. I know something of the
               atmosphere of <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Hawaii</span> and I wrote the story
               myself. I am just sure that if we can get things into film as we see them here the
               island will owe us a very great deal of gratitude.</p>
            
            <p part="N"> "One scene will be taken showing the departure of a steamer and including that
               lovable custom of giving leis, which is to me most touching. When I left <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Honolulu</span> last spring returning to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Los Angeles</span> I cried as the boat pulled away from the dock.
               I was not leaving a host of friends either, but there is something about the strains
               of 'Aloha Oe' which brings the moisture to the eyes and a catch to the throat. This
               atmosphere is what we hope to catch in our <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span>, and we hope that when it comes back to <span xmlns="" style="color: red">Honolulu </span>as a finished product the people will think that
               we have done full justice to our theme."</p>

               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Ivers</span> is a pioneer in the moving <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span> profession, having been identified with it
               in every sort of a capacity for the last nine years. She knows the game from A to
               Z.
               "I will have no one to blame if I fail to get a good <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span>," she says. "<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mr. Lasky</span>
               permitted me to select my own cast and to choose my technical force, camera man, art
               director and all. I am in full charge and I have every confidence in my company.
               There is not a person in it who will not go the limit to do as he or she is told.
               I
               know they will all give their very best to make the <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span> a success."</p>
            
            <p part="N">
               <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Ivers</span> believes she is especially fortunate in
               her choice of her art director, George Hopkins<span xmlns="" style="color: blue;"></span>. "He is really very
               superior," she said, "and has done some wonderful work on interiors. He has a weird
               touch which makes his work stand out."</p>
            
            <p part="N"> While a number of locations have been chosen, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs.
                  Ivers</span> said that they may not be used. "You see," she said, "the art
               director, the camera man, and electrician always inspect a location before we begin
               to 'shoot.' If any one of them has a fault to find I simply give up the location and
               seek something else that will be suitable. The art director and <span xmlns="" style="color: green">the camera</span> man have to produce the artistic part of
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">the film </span>. I have my company in the center of
               the location and I am often called upon to move the actors to one side or another
               in
               order that <span xmlns="" style="color: green">the camera</span> may register striking
               features that may be at one side or the other of those of the cast. It would never
               do
               to have <span xmlns="" style="color: green">the film </span>unbalanced."</p>
            
            <p part="N">The very newest in motion <span xmlns="" style="color: green">picture</span>
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">cameras</span>s will be used by the company here.
               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">The "Mitchell,"</span> a machine which combines all

                  other older style cameras</span> to be used.</p>
            
            <p part="N">It is possible that work of filming may start before Friday, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Ivers</span> said.</p>
