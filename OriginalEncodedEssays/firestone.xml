            <p>NANCE: <persName ref="Peavey">Mr. Peavey</persName>, were you employed by <persName ref="Taylor">Mr.

            <p>NANCE: Were you employed by <persName ref="Taylor">the dead man</persName> in the case?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Yes,sir.</p>

            <p>NANCE: How long have you been working for him?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: <time>About six months</time>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Were you in the <placeName type="living">house</placeName> on <time>the evening when he

            <p>NANCE: What time did you leave the <placeName type="living">house</placeName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: I figured it was about <time>a quarter past [seven]</time> that I left the
                  <placeName type="living">house</placeName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Where was he when you left?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: He was sitting in a <objectName type="furniture">chair</objectName> facing ust to the
               [illegible] now, and Miss Normand was sitting in a <objectName type="furniture">chair</objectName>
               just the same. They were discussing <objectName type="posession">a red-backed book</objectName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: In what part of the <placeName type="living">house</placeName> were they?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: They were near the <placeName type="room">dining-room</placeName>, where you enter the
                  <placeName type="room">dining-room</placeName> from the
               <placeName type="room">living-room</placeName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: That is a <placeName type="living">two-story apartment</placeName>, is it not?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Yes, sir.</p>

            <p>NANCE: And on the <placeName type="wing">ground floor</placeName>, how many rooms?</p>

                  <placeName type="living">apartment</placeName> is immediately into the front there, is it
               not-the <placeName type="room">front room</placeName>, rather?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: The <placeName type="room">front room</placeName>, yes sir.</p>

            <p>NANCE: They were seated?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Near the <placeName type="room">dining-room</placeName> there, in the
                  <placeName type="room">living-room</placeName>, near the <placeName type="passage">entrance to the
                  dining-room</placeName>. </p>

            <p>NANCE: When you went out, which way did you go out, at <placeName type="passage">the
                  front</placeName> or <placeName type="passage">the back</placeName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: I went out <placeName type="passage">the front way</placeName>. I always lock up the
                  <objectName type="passage">back door</objectName> when I go out. I always lock the
                  <objectName type="passage">back door screen</objectName>; it has a <objectName type="thing">hook</objectName>
               on the inside. I used the <objectName type="passage">front door</objectName> to come out <time>all
                  the time</time>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Did you carry <objectName type="posession">the back door key</objectName> with you?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: No, sir. I always turn it in the <objectName type="passage">door</objectName> and leave it
               just as it is.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Now, when did you next see <persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: The <time>next morning</time>, when I went to work.</p>

            <p>NANCE: On arriving there, what did you do?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY. <eventName type="action">I picked up the paper</eventName> first; <eventName type="action">I stopped in a
                  drug store</eventName> at the <placeName type="buisness">corner of 5th and Los Angeles</placeName>
               to get a <objectName type="consumable">bottle of medicine</objectName> - <objectName type="consumable">milk of
                  magnesia</objectName>, <persName ref="Taylor">he</persName> usually takes that every morning; <eventName type="action">I bought
                  that</eventName> on my way out. <eventName type="action">I picked up the paper and unlocked the
                  door</eventName>. The first thing I saw was his feet. <eventName>I looked at his
                  feet a few minutes and said, "<persName ref="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName>." <persName ref="Taylor">He</persName> never moved. I
                  stepped a little further in the <objectName>door</objectName>, and seen his
                     <objectName>face</objectName>, and turned and ran out and
               hollered</eventName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Who did you summon? Who did you call to?</p>

            <p> PEAVEY: I don't know.</p>

            <p>NANCE: You just made a lot of noise to attract all the attention you could?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Yes, sir.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Several people came, did they?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Yes, sir. I think <persName type="Taylor">Mr. Desmond [sic]</persName>, and the
                  <persName type="Jessurun">gentleman</persName> who owns <placeName type="Neighborhood">the court</placeName> was the
               first.</p>

            <p>NANCE: You mean <persName type="Jessurun">Mr. Jessurun</persName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Yes, sir.</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: And Mr. - you see, I don't know their names - I just seen them - the two
               gentlemens next door, <persName type="MacLean">Mr. MacLean</persName> and Mr. - I can't
                  think of the other gentleman's name - right next door to us [<persName type="Maigne">Charles
               Maigne]</persName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: You didn't come back there after you had gone away, when <persName type="Normand">Miss Normand</persName> was
               there with <persName type="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: No, sir.</p>

            <p>NANCE: When you went out, was anybody around <placeName type="living">the place</placeName>? </p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Only <persName type="Normand">Miss Normand's chauffeur</persName>; he had his <objectName type="tool">lights</objectName> all on inside the <objectName type="car">limousine</objectName>,
               cleaning it. <eventName type="action">I hit him on the back and stopped and talked to him <time>a few minutes</time></eventName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: When you <time>first opened the door</time>, did you see any furniture overturned, or any
               sign of a disturbance in the house?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Nothing more than a <objectName type="furniture">chair</objectName> that was sitting next to the wall had been pushed
               out a little bit and his <objectName type="bodypart">feet</objectName> was under this <objectName type="furniture">chair</objectName>. The rest of the <objectName type="decorations">furniture</objectName> around
               the <placeName type="living">house</placeName> and <placeName type="room">room upstairs</placeName> was just as I left them when I went away that
               evening.</p>

            <p>NANCE: And did you notice whether anything had been taken off of his <objectName type="bodypart">body</objectName>, or not -
               any <objectName type="posessions">jewelry</objectName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: I didn't notice that; I didn't touch him at all.</p>

            <p> NANCE: Do you know whether he wore any valuable <objectName type="posessions">jewelry</objectName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Yes sir, he had a <objectName type="posessions">wrist watch</objectName> and another<objectName type="posession"> watch</objectName> with a lot of little trinkets
               on; and a <objectName type="posession">thing</objectName> you stamp <objectName type="money">checks</objectName> with to keep anybody from making the <objectName type="money">checks</objectName> any big-
               ger, and a <objectName type="posession">lead pencil</objectName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Did he have a <objectName type="posession">diamond ring</objectName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Yes sir, he had a large <objectName type="posession">diamond ring</objectName> that he wore.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Do you know whether he had it on that <time>evening</time>?,</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Yes sir, he was dressed just as when I went <time>that evening</time>, as I found him the
               next morning.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Was the <objectName type="posession">ring</objectName> on his <objectName type="bodypart">finger</objectName> the <time>next morning</time>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Yes sir, his other <objectName type="posession">jewelry</objectName> that I had put away <time>the night before</time> was just as I
               had put it away up in the <objectName type="storage">dresser drawer</objectName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: You didn't find anything taken from the <placeName type="living">apartment</placeName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: No sir, it was just as when I left it when I found it. The <objectName type="decoration">rug</objectName> was a little
               bit kicked up. It looked like he had kicked it with his foot.</p>

            <p>NANCE: There was no other disturbance there?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: No, sir. Even the <placeName type="room">living-room</placeName> <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName> that I had moved aside. The <objectName type="furniture">rocking chair</objectName>
               would hit the <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName>, and I moved the <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName> so the <objectName type="furniture">rocking chair</objectName> would not hit the
               <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName>. It was just as I left it.</p>

            <p>NANCE: By a juror: Were any of the <objectName type="decoration">windows</objectName> up at night?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: No sir, we had those little long <objectName type="thng">pins</objectName> that runs in the <objectName type="decoration">windows</objectName>. The <objectName type="decoration">windows</objectName>
               <placeName type="wing">upstairs</placeName> in his <placeName type="room">bedroom</placeName> were up. The <objectName type="decoration">windows</objectName> downstairs I always locked with this peg
               that slipped in the <objectName type="decoration">window</objectName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Were they still that way in the <time>morning</time>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: They were still that way in the <time>morning</time>. The <objectName type="tool">lights</objectName> were burning just as I
               had left them <time>that night</time>; <objectName type="tool">two lights</objectName>, one in the <placeName type="room">living-room</placeName> and one in the
               <placeName type="room">dining-room</placeName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE:That is all, you may be excused.</p>

            <p>I hereby certify that I, as shorthand reporter, correctly took down in shorthand the
               testimony and proceedings had at the within named Coroner's inquest; that the
               foregoing is a full, true and correct copy of my shorthand notes and a full, true and
               correct statement of the testimony and pro- ceedings had at said inquest. E.M. Allen,
               Shorthand Reporter</p>
