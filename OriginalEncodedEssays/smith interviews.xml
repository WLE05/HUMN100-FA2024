            <p>ROBERTSON: <persName ref="hoyt">Mr. Hoyt</persName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: He said she had been pesticating around there and got to be a great deal of
               annoyance.</p>

            <p> ROBERTSON: No, that was <date>last Saturday *** that was the 28th</date>.</p>

            <p>ROBERTSON: She <eventName type="disturbance">threatened to scream</eventName>. She was very obnoxious to

            <p>MR. CHARLES EYTON Gen. Mgr. Famous Players-Lasky Statement taken 11-30-25 at 2:20
               PM</p>

            <p> A. (Speaking of the morning following the murder) ** I was called on the
                  <objectName type="device">telephone</objectName>, I should judge at <time>8</time> by his
               assistant <persName ref="harry">Harry Fellows</persName>, and he told me. He said,
                  "<persName ref="eyton">Mr. Eyton</persName>, when I came over to <persName
                  ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName> room <date>this morning</date>, I
                  <eventName type="mortality">found him dead</eventName>." And I says, "Dead? What is the matter?" He
               says "Well, we have had a <persName ref="doctor">docto</persName> here and he tells
               us it is a <eventName type="illness">hemorhhage of the stomach</eventName>. **</p>

            <p>A. That would make it about <time>8:30</time>, I should judge.</p>
            <p> A. I didn't go through <placeName type="residency">the house</placeName>. <persName ref="maigne"
                  >Charley Maigne</persName> and <persName ref="hoyt">Arthur Hoyt</persName> and
                  <persName ref="douglas">Douglas MacLean</persName> and <persName ref="harry">Harry
                  Fellows</persName>.</p>
            <p> A. ** <persName ref="douglas">Douglas MacLean</persName> was the first man that put
               it into my head that he (<persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>) <eventName type="mortality">was
                  murdered</eventName>. He said he was confident that he had <eventName type="murder">heard a
                  shot</eventName>
               <date>the night before</date>. He said to me, "<persName ref="maigne"
                  >Charley</persName>, don't let them take his body away with out turning it over,
               because I think we heard a <eventName type="murder">shot last night</eventName>."</p>

            <p> Q. Have you any idea who did the <eventName type="communication">telephoning</eventName> around about
                  <eventName>the murder</eventName>?</p>
            <p> A. No. <persName ref="harry">Harry Fellows</persName>
               <eventName type="communication">telephoned me</eventName>.</p>
            <p> Q. Did you hear anybody call up <persName ref="Mabel">Mabel Normand</persName> or
                  <persName ref="Shelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName>?</p>
            <p>A. No. That all happened before I got there, if <persName ref="shelby">Mrs.
                  Shelby</persName> was called up. <persName ref="mabel">Mabel Normand</persName>
               was called up, I know. <persName ref="Maigne">Charley Maigne</persName> told me.</p>
            <p> Q. What was the position of the <objectName type="bodypart">body</objectName> when you first saw
               it?</p>
            <p> A. <objectName type="bodypart">The body</objectName> when I first saw it lay right <placeName type="positioning">in
                  front of the desk</placeName>, with the head back. <placeName type="positioning">The desk was near
                  his feet</placeName>.</p>

            <p> A. ** Of course <persName ref="mary">Mary</persName> was <eventName type="betroth">engaged to
                  marry</eventName>
               <persName ref="neilan">Mickey Neilan</persName>, so she told me, but I don't think
               there was very much to that.</p>
            <p>Q. This trouble with <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>, when was that?</p>
            <p> A. He and <persName ref="neilan">Mickey</persName>? Oh, <persName ref="neilan"
                  >Mickey</persName> said something one night. They were drunk and
                  <persName ref="neilan">Mickey</persName> apologized. It was nothing serious.</p>

            <p>Q. Do you know <persName ref="neva">Neva Gerber</persName>?</p>
            <p> A. Yes. That was one of <persName ref="taylor">Taylor's</persName> former flames,
               before any of this came up.</p>
            <p> ** When he <eventName type="wartime">went to war</eventName> it was understood that when he came
               back he was going to <eventName type="betroth">marry</eventName>
               <persName ref="neva">Neva Gerber</persName>.</p>

            <p> ~~~~~</p>

            <p> NEIL HARRINGTON, Neighbor Statement taken 2-9-22</p>

            <p> POLICE: *** I understand you went over with <persName ref="dumas">Mr.
                  Dumas</persName>?</p>

            <p> HARRINGTON: I went in there first.</p>

            <p> POLICE: When you saw <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName>
               <eventName type="positioning">lying out</eventName>
               <placeName type="positioning">on the floor</placeName>, why <objectName type="garments">his clothing</objectName> was
               perfectly arranged, was it not?</p>

            <p> HARRINGTON: Perfectly arranged. I made the remark at the time, "I don't believe the
               man fell in that position." (Re man peeping in windows of <persName ref="taylor"
                  >Taylor's</persName>
               <placeName type="residency">home</placeName> in <date>August, 1921</date>) Between <persName
                  ref="taylor">Taylor's</persName> house and the garage, there is the
                  two windows, and <persName ref="taylor"
               >Taylor</persName>‚Äôs house the window to the living room and the window to the
               kitchen - *** I saw <eventName type="suspisous">a man peeking in the curtain</eventName>, and as he
               saw me‚Äî this man, I believe I would recognize-- as he heard me he started and
               stopped naturally, rather frightened, and he didn't say a word, but whirled right
               around and <eventName type="movement">walked out</eventName>.</p>

            <p> POLICE: Do you know whether <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> was there
               or not?</p>

            <p> HARRINGTON: There was a light in there, *** I should say probably along about the
                  <date>20th of August</date>.</p>

            <p> POLICE: How would you describe the <objectName type="bodypart">fellow's face</objectName>?</p>

            <p> HARRINGTON: Rather a good looking fellow, good features. Of course I couldn't tell
               whether <objectName type="bodypart">his face</objectName> was ruddy complexion --</p>

            <p> POLICE: Regular features?</p>

            <p>HARRINGTON: Yes, regular features. It wasn't <persName ref="Peavey">Taylor's
                  chauffeur</persName> at that time.</p>

            <p> POLICE: About what time was it <time>in the evening</time>?</p>

            <p> HARRINGTON: Oh, somewhat around <time>9 o‚Äôclock</time>,<time> early in the
                  evening</time>.</p>

            <p>~~~~~</p>

            <p>CHARLES MAIGNE (Friend of Taylor) Statement taken 2-9-22</p>

            <p> MAIGNE: ** After I got over the shock of <eventName type="mortality">Bill's
                  death</eventName>, was wondering how on earth <persName ref="taylor"
                  >Bill</persName> could have fallen the way he did. The position that <persName
                  ref="taylor">Bill</persName> was in stumped me for two solid days *** If he had
               been sitting in his chair and <eventName type="murder">had been shot</eventName>, or if he
                  <eventName type="murder">had been shot</eventName> in <objectName type="bodypart">his back</objectName> with his
               back to the door, he was lying stretched out with his <placeName type="positoning">feet towards the
                  door</placeName>, <objectName type="bodypart">hands</objectName> by his side. There was no
                  <objectName type="liquid">blood</objectName> anywhere except directly under <objectName type="bodypart">his
                  head</objectName> where <objectName type="liquid">the blood</objectName> had run out of
                  <objectName type="bodypart">his mouth</objectName> from the hemorrhage and a little bit directly
               under where the wound in the back was.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Was the <objectName type="garments">clothing</objectName> all properly arranged?</p>

            <p>MAIGNE: <objectName type="garments">Clothing</objectName> all <eventName type="positioning">properly
                  arranged</eventName>. (Speaking of the condition of the room when he first saw
                  it<date> the morning after the murder</date>)</p>

            <p>WINN: There were also papers on <objectName type="furniture">the
                  couch</objectName>? *** I know when you came up there about <time> 9:15 or
                  9:30</time>.</p>

            <p>MAIGNE: <time>Around 9:30 or 10 o'clock</time>. **** Before we had been there a half
               or three-quarters of an hour, I noticed <objectName type="money">three or four checks</objectName>
               on the floor alongside of <persName ref="taylor">Bill</persName>,
                  <objectName type="money">cancelled checks</objectName>. They were <placeName type="positioning">not on the
                  floor</placeName> when I came in. This pile of <objectName type="money">cancelled
                  checks</objectName> was almost smooth and level right on <objectName type="furniture">his
                  desk</objectName>, just as though he had been interrupted in his work and nobody
               had touched them. ** On <date>the night after</date>
               <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> was <eventName type="murder">killed</eventName>
               <eventName type="communication">I called up</eventName>
               <persName ref="earl">Earl Tiffany</persName> and had him come up to <placeName type="residency">the
                  house</placeName>. *** His wife came up with him *** The first thing he told me
               was that his wife had positively seen <persName ref="sands">Sands</persName> at the
               corner of <placeName type="street">Fifth and Figueroa</placeName>, I think it was, at <time>1:15
                  PM</time> on the day before <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> was murdered.
               She had known <persName ref="sands">Sands</persName> and <persName ref="earl"
                  >Tiffany</persName> before she married <persName ref="earl">
               Tiffany</persName>.</p>

            <p>(Second Statement taken 12-1-25)</p>

            <p> MAIGNE: It must have been about half past <time>7 in the morning</time> of the day
               that <persName ref="taylor">Bill</persName>was killed that <persName ref="maid">Miss
                  Normand's maid</persName> came over and wanted to see me right away. *** I hurried
