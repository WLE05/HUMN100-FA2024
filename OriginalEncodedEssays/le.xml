            <head>Interview with Mrs.Charlotte Shelby</head>
            <byline>William Le</byline>

            <p> MRS. CHARLOTTE SHELBY mother of Mary M.Minter Statement taken 4-9-26 </p>


            <p> POLICE: During the time in the east there, when he (Taylor) was directing her
               (Mary), did you observe any awakening of a friendship or love between the two of
               them?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: No.</p>

            <p>POLICE: When did you first see that, or did you at all?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: I never did know it, <persName>Mr. Keyes</persName>, until <persName>Mr. Mott</persName> told
               me of the letters that had been found in Taylor's <placeName>drawer</placeName> that
               absolutely is convincing that there had been something there.</p>

            <p>POLICE: You mean after he was killed</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Yes, and <persName>Mr. Eyton</persName> told me also after <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName>
               was killed that he knew that, that he knew for a long time that <persName>Mary and Mr.
                  Taylor</persName> had been intimate, and I said then "<persName> Mr. Eyton</persName> you
               should have told me."</p>

            <p>POLICE: During that time. <persName>Mrs. Shelby</persName> (referring to latter part of 1919
               and early part of 1920), was Mary going around with Taylor to your knowledge at
               all?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Why no, and <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName> was the most perfectly poised man, such a
               proper man. He would take Mary out to <name>dinner</name> and he would invariably invite me and my
               mother to go to dinner with them.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did you make any objections?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Not the least in the world.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Were you friendly with him?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Oh, yes. ***</p>

            <p>POLICE: Do you remember anyone in particular with whom she was associating at that
               time?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: It wasn't men. Men hadn't begun to give me any trouble at that time. It was
               women.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Who was that?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: <persName>Jeannie McPherson</persName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Taylor's name never entered into <name>the discussion</name> then?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: No. I always felt that, when <persName>Mary</persName> was out with <persName>Mr.
                  Taylor</persName> she was under a good influence. ***</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did you ever have any words with <persName>Mr. Taylo</persName>r over
                  <persName>Mary</persName>?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Never a word, never the slightest word. (Speaking of the time <persName>Mrs.
                  Shelby</persName> went to <placeName>Taylor's home</placeName> at 2 a.m. looking for
                  <name>Mary</name>).</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did this secretary of yours, <persName>Miss Whitney</persName>, go in <placeName>the
                  house</placeName> with you?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: No, I know she didn‚Äôt because there was nobody in <placeName>the
                  room</placeName> but <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName> and me. She stayed in the car.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did you have any weapon with you at that time?</p>

            <p> SHELBY: Good lord, no.</p>

            <p>POLICE: You are sure you didn't have <objectName>a revolver</objectName> with
               you?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: No, <persName>Mr. Keye</persName>s.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Well, you owned <objectName>a revolver</objectName> at that time?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: No. If I owned <objectName>a revolver</objectName> at that time, I don‚Äôt
               know where it was. It was thrown away.</p>

            <p>POLICE: What date was it when you were at Mr. Taylor's home that you were telling
               about?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: I think I could almost fix that date,<persName> Mr. Keyes</persName>, referring to
                  <objectName>a certain little book</objectName>, you know. Because I was reading
                  <objectName>Mary's diary</objectName> and she goes on to say in this
                  <objectName>diary</objectName> that she and I had some little words that evening,
               you see, and she has written it very clearly, about the small girl going out in a
               huff, etc., and she adds that mother was right. **** And I think the date of that
               happeningis right in her diary.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did you ever make a threat to kill<persName> Mr. Taylor</persName></p>

            <p>SHELBY: No, <persName>Mr. Keyes</persName>. I never had any reason or desire to kill
                  <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: And you are positive, are you, <persName>Mrs. Shelby</persName>, that you never at
               any time threatened <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName>?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Certainly not, I had no reason. I never threatened to shot <persName>Mr.
                  Taylor</persName>. I don't think I ever threatened to shoot any man. To shoot him? No,
               because I had no reason. I had no provocation. I never had a quarrel with <persName>Mr.
                  Taylor</persName> in my life.</p>

            <p>POLICE: You spoke of having thrown <objectName>a gun</objectName> away?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: No, my mother did that.</p>

            <p>POLICE: That was your gun?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Yes. It was <objectName>a gun</objectName> I used once. I shot it once and
               once was enough.</p>

            <p>POLICE: How long had you had <objectName>the gun</objectName>?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: <objectName>The gun</objectName> was given to me in Santa Barbara by
                <persName>Harry Eaves</persName>, who has a jewelry shop up there ‚Äî <objectName>a very
                  short little pistoi</objectName> - a little automatic - ***** and he said to me,
               "I have got two and you ought to have one.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Where did you say you shot it once?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: I got a friend of mine to take me out in <placeName>Santa
               Barbara</placeName>, just off the road, and we shot it into a bank and I shot it
               once.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did you ever do any target practice with it?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Yes, that one time. It was enough for me. The thing was too short. I can
               shoot a long pistol. I wouldn‚Äôt mind shooting a shot gun. ***</p>

            <p>POLICE: Well, <persName>Mrs. Shelby</persName>, <persName>Mary</persName> shot that
                  <objectName>pistol</objectName> off one time, didn't she?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Yes, she shot it off twice.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Was that the "suicide"?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: That‚Äôs the ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù (Re: supposed suicide) "Well, we were living at
                  <placeName>56 Fremont Place</placeName>. **** I remember the secretary was there
               that night, <persName>Miss Whitney</persName> *** She (Mary) rushed up <objectName>the
                  stairs</objectName> saying "I am going to end it, all. I am going to end it all.
               ** Then <persName>Charlotte</persName> (Miss ‚ÄúWhitney) said to me, "<persName>Mrs.
                  Shelby</persName>, oh, <persName>Mrs. Shelby</persName>, there's a pistol in your closet." ***
               But she ran up the stairs and ran in my room and closed the door.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did she lock the door?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Oh, locked <placeName>the door</placeName>, and the first thing we knew- bang. *** and a second more
               and - bang ‚Äì the second shot. **** The chauffeur (<persName>Chauncey Eaton</persName>)
               appeared, and <persName>the night watchman</persName> (?), and I said "Break in the door" The two men
               rushed against the door, the door fell in, and there lay <persName>Mary</persName> on my bedroom floor ***
               They picked her up so tenderly, and <persName>Chauncey</persName> turned her over and he said, "Why,
                  <persName>Mrs. Shelb</persName>y, there is no blood on her." **** By that time the
               secretary had faded out of the picture in a faint *** and she (<persName>Mrs. Shelby's mother</persName>,
               Mrs. Miles) said, "Why no, she is not shot; stand her up, Chauncey." *** Then she
               (Mary) looked at us and said, "I thought I would give you all a jolt."</p>

            <p>POLICE: ** was there anything said about <name>Taylor</name> in that? Did he have
               anything to do with that quarrel?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: No, I don't think he had anything to do with that *** I may have asked her if
               she had been out with . But there was no quarrel about <name>Mr. Taylor</name>? It
               seems to me she mentioned Taylor's name. I don't remember now, or what. Then the
               report that I got that you have been practicing some rerevolver shooting - is there
               anything to that? I told you I shot it once. I know a man who will verify it -
                  <name>Mr. Stockdale</name>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: No other <objectName>pistol</objectName> at any other time?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: No, I am afraid of <objectName>pistols</objectName>. ***</p>

            <p>POLICE: What did your mother do with<objectName> your pistol</objectName> after
                  <persName>Mary</persName> pulled this stunt.</p>

            <p>SHELBY: That was all there was to it. Of course, we found <persName>Charlotte
                  Witney</persName> in a faint on the <placeName>floor</placeName> and we had to revive her. *** And
                 <persName>Chauncey</persName> was trying to find out where <objectName>the
                  bullets</objectName> went, and we discovered <objectName>one bullet</objectName>
               had been shot into my closet, and we found that, and another one went up in the
               ceiling of the closet. I remember mother taking <objectName>the pistol</objectName>.
               he said, "Here, give me that. That‚Äôs enough of <objectName>pistols</objectName> lying around.</p>

            <p>POLICE: What did she do with it. I never saw it again. I think I asked her once or
               twice what she did with it, and she said, "It's out. It's put away."</p>

            <p>SHELBY: I had <name>an engagement</name> with a man the next morning at 9 o'clock. ** This man was
               a client of a friend of my daughter's, <name>Mr. Albert Heiner</name>. *** I also had
               been talking to a man about buying <objectName>an Aeolian Organ</objectName>, and he stopped in that morning
               *** And while these two men were in the room, the telephone rang. It was then a
               little after 9, and <persName>Mr. Carl Stocktdle</persName> called me up. He had gone to the
               studio to work and had learned of the death of <persName>William Desmond Taylor</persName>.
               Naturally, knowing that he directed <persName>Mary</persName>, he called me up and told me
               that <persName>William Desmond Taylor</persName> had been found dead that morning.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Just what did he tell you?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: He said, "<persName>Mrs. Shelby</persName>, I just wanted to call you up and tell
               you, I am at <placeName>the studio</placeName>. <persName>William Desmond Taylor</persName> was found dead this
               morning." "Oh," I said, "that's terrible." That's all he knew. ** I turned to these
               gentlemen and said, "Oh, my, it's terrible. A man who directed my daughter, a very
               charming gentleman, was found dead this morning." **** Then <objectName>the
                  telephone</objectName> rang again and the inevitable Miss Berger again. *** I
               said, "Oh, <persName>Margery</persName>, <persName>Mr. Stockdale</persName> just telephoned me from
                  <placeName>the studio</placeName> that <name>Mr. Taylor</name> was found dead this
               morning." **** In a few minutes <objectName>the telephone</objectName> rang again.
               *** This time <persName>Miss Berger</persName> said, "<persName>William Desmond Taylor</persName> was
               murdered this morning. He was shot." I said, "Oh, my, this is terrible; the man was
               murdered," Was shot? So we discussed that and the organ man knew I was waiting to go
               out with <persName>Mr. Rice</persName> so ** <persName>Mr. Rice</persName> and I got in his car *** and I said, ‚ÄúMr. Rice, do
               you mind if I stop at <placeName>my house</placeName> and tell my people?" *** and it seems to me that on
               the way crossing <placeName>Vermont</placeName> met my mother coming over in a car with the chauffeur and I
               just waved to her to turn around and come on back with us. I remember that
               distinctly. ***** I was in a great hurry because <persName>Mr. Rice</persName> was waiting
               for me in front, and I remember the chauffeur had parked <objectName>my blue Packard</objectName> in the
               <placeName>driveway</placeName>, and something was said about Mary wanted <objectName>the car</objectName>.
               <persName>Chauncey</persName> had gone to get <objectName>Mary's car</objectName>. However, I went
                  <placeName>upstairs</placeName> in a great hurry, and I said, "Oh,
               <persName> Julia</persName>, dear, Mr. Taylor was murdered last night." She said, "Oh, it
               isn't possible. I can't believe it. It isn't true." I said, "Oh, yes, it is.
                 <persName>Miss Berger</persName> told me so." *****</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did <persName>Mr. Woolwine</persName> ever try to take your statement?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: No, he never asked me a thing, <persName>Mr. Keyes</persName>. Nobody ever questioned
               me.</p>

            <p>MR. MOTT: Tell <persName>Mr. Keye</persName>s exactly now, that part of the conversation with
              <persName> Chauncey</persName>?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: I said "<persName>Chauncey</persName>, what did you tell them?" He said, "I told them
               that you called me up very early that morning, about half past seven, and my wife
               said you went ever there without breakfast; that you wanted to go over to
                  <placeName>the Hobart house</placeName>." I said, "The morning of the Taylor
               murder." He said, "Yes." I said, "Why, I couldn't have known until after 9
               o‚Äôclock.‚Äù He said that he drove me over that morning and said that I was at the
               wisdom with <objectName>the papers</objectName> I said, "How could that be; besides there wasn't any <objectName>papers</objectName>
               that morning." "No," he said, "that's what they told me down at <placeName>the
                  office</placeName>, that there wasn‚Äôt any papers that early." I said, "Well,
               that's nothing, it is just a laps of memory, it is of no consequence." And finally he
               saw he was in the wrong. I explained to him that <persName>Mr. Rice</persName> had driven me
               over."</p>

            <p>MR. MOTT: Now explain that Monte Blue proposition.</p>

            <p>SHELBY: (<persName>Mrs. Shelby</persName> tells about some night when Mary had failed to come
              <placeName> home</placeName>, and they had looked for her until about 2:30 a.m. and finally located
                  <objectName>her car</objectName> in front of <placeName>Charlotte Whitney's
                  house</placeName>) So <persName>Margaret</persName> and I rushed in and went up the steps
               hurriedly and opened <placeName>the door</placeName> and came upon Mary &amp; Monte (Blue) on the couch. The
               door opened right into the front room. This Monte Blue started to run out into <placeName>the
               kitchen</placeName> and out <placeName>the back door</placeName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: You mean that they were in a compromising position?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Yes. I was about the maddest woman that could ever be. I grabbed this
               halfbreed Indian by his shirt tail and I said, "Come right back in <placeName>this
                  room</placeName>. I have something very forceful to say to you. Come back
               here!"</p>

            <p>MR. DAVIS: That time she went out with <persName>Marshall Neilan</persName>, after the
               murder; wasn't that about two nights afterwards?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Yes.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Immediately afterwards, wasn't it?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: It was.</p>

            <p>MR. KEYES: She tried to kill you, you say?</p>

            <p>SHELBY: Yes. *** Oh, "Mary said around the house freely. "Oh, <name>4</name> killed
               Taylor". Not only once but many times. The was always saying that.</p>
