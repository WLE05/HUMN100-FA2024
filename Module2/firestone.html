I picked up the paper and unlocked the door. The first thing I saw was his feet. I looked at his feet a few minutes and said, "<span class="persName">Mr. Taylor</span>." <span class="persName">He</span> never moved. I stepped a little further in the door, and seen his face, and turned and ran out and hollered.</p><p>NANCE: Who did you summon?

I hit <span class="persName">him</span> on the back and stopped and talked to <span class="persName">him</span> a few minutes.</p><p>NANCE: When you first opened the door, did you see any furniture overturned, or any sign of a disturbance in the house?</p><p>PEAVEY: Nothing more than a chair that was sitting next to the wall had been pushed out a little bit and <span class="persName">his</span> feet was under this chair. The rest of the furniture around the <span class="placeName">house</span> and <span class="placeName">room upstairs</span> was just as I left them when I went away that evening.</p><p>NANCE: And did you notice whether anything had been taken off of <span class="persName">his</span> body, or not - any jewelry?</p><p>PEAVEY: I didn't notice that; I didn't touch <span class="persName">him</span> at all.</p><p>NANCE: Do you know whether <span class="persName">he</span> wore any valuable jewelry?</p><p>PEAVEY: Yes sir, <span class="persName">he</span> had a wrist watch and anotherwatch with a lot of little trinkets on; and a thing you stamp checks with to keep anybody from making the checks any big- ger, and a lead pencil.</p><p>NANCE: Did <span class="persName">he</span> have a diamond ring?</p><p>PEAVEY: Yes sir, <span class="persName">he</span> had a large diamond ring that <span class="persName">he</span> wore.</p><p>NANCE: Do you know whether <span class="persName">he</span> had it on that evening?,</p><p>PEAVEY: Yes sir, <span class="persName">he</span> was dressed just as when I went that evening, as I found <span class="persName">him</span> the next morning.</p><p>NANCE: Was the ring on his finger the next morning?</p><p>PEAVEY: Yes sir, <span class="persName">his</span> other jewelry that I had put away the night before was just as I had put it away up in the dresser drawer.</p><p>NANCE: You didn't find anything taken from the <span class="placeName">apartment</span>?</p><p>PEAVEY: No sir, it was just as when I left it when I found it. The rug was a little bit kicked up. It looked like he had kicked it with his foot.</p><p>NANCE: There was no other disturbance there?</p><p>PEAVEY: No, sir. Even the <span class="placeName">living-room</span> table that I had moved aside. The rocking chair would hit the table, and I moved the table so the rocking chair would not hit the table. It was just as I left it.</p><p>NANCE: By a juror: Were any of the windows up at night?</p><p>PEAVEY: No sir, we had those little long pins that runs in the windows. The windows <span class="placeName">upstairs</span> in <span class="persName">his</span> <span class="placeName">bedroom</span> were up. The windows downstairs I always locked with this peg that slipped in the window.</p><p>NANCE: Were they still that way in the morning?</p><p>PEAVEY: They were still that way in the morning.
